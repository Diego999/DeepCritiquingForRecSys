Fans of the first disk shouldn't be too dissapointed. The songs sound very similar, Avril sticking to her &quot;mean punk skater girl&quot; approach. She has written almost all of the songs on the album, which is respectable considering that most of her peers don't. Standouts include &quot;Take Me Away,&quot; &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; and &quot;My Happy Ending.&quot;Overall rating: Three and a half stars.\",\n",
       " \"I bought this album the first week it came out. At first I wasn't sure I liked it as much as Let Go, but having listened to it several times since then, I like it even more than her first album. On this album, Avril is able to take her music in a decidedly more grown-up direction while retaining its catchiness.1)Take Me Away: a great album opener. One of the best songs here.2)Together: I love how Avril sounds at the beginning of this song. She really shows off her range here.3)Don't Tell Me: great choice as the first single. I love the song's message and I love the chorus.4)He Wasn't: the &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; of this album. Very catchy.5)How Does It Feel: a terrific song in the vein of &quot;I'm With You&quot;. Avril sounds terrific here.6)My Happy Ending: my favorite song on the album. An excellent choice as the second single. I just love this song.7)Nobody's Home: her collaboration with Ben Moody. Very good song.8)Forgotten: another great song. I love how Avril sounds on this song. One of my favorites.9)Who Knows: surprisingly upbeat, considering how everone thinks she is always so sour in her music.10)Fall To Pieces: I really like this song. It's very catchy.11)Freak Out: a good song. The lyrics are a little cliched (&quot;Walk around with your hands up in the air like you don't care&quot;), but it's still good.12)Slipped Away: very good song. It's a good tribute to her grandfather, and it proves Avril is more than just &quot;boys boys boys&quot;.Overall this is a very good album. Avril definitely avoids the sophomore slump. What makes the album even better is that she didn't work with The Matrix this time around. Since they were largely responsible for her signature sound, I wondered if she could pull off an album without them. Thankfully, she did. These songs are even better and catchier than the hits off her first album. On her next album, I would love to see Avril go even further in the darker direction she takes on many of the songs here. I think most of the negative reviews here are by people who just hate Avril and haven't even listened to the album. Coming from someone who actually listened to this CD, I highly recommend it.\",\n",
       " \"I really, really loved this CD once it hit store shelves back in May 2004. I still feel the same about it, really. It's kinda surprising.*** Take Me Away...is one of Her most angst-ridden recordings, but it's OK I guess. Just don't plan on putting it on repeat.**1/2 Together...is very forgettable. Forgot it!****1/2 Don't Tell Me...This is quite the kiss-off!*** He Wasn't...Meh/10***1/2 How Does It Feel...Kinda mellow, to be honest. It's not too bad. Quite listen-able, and the lyrics are decent. It's a keeper, I suppose. ^_^***3/4 My Happy Ending...This is decent also.****1/2 Nobody's Home...One of Avril's most insightful pop songs with a bit of meaning. Her best track here.**** Forgotten...I really, REALLY like this song. It's kinda hard. And the lyrics are cool. Like the swagger on this one. And I'm no fan of Hers anymore.***3/4 Who Knows...Pleasant pop tune.***1/2 Fall to Pieces...Like this one too. Not as strong as Forgotten, or Nobody's Home, but solid nonetheless.***1/2 Freak Out...Was cool and still is to just chill to.***3/4 Slipped Away...Avril, if it does any good, I'm super sorry that You're grandpa died so suddenly. But it can't be worse then never knowing any of Your grandparents, which is the story of My life. But I'm still sorry, nonetheless.47.25/12 = 3.93753.9375 = 3.94********************************************************************************3.94 stars.\",\n",

       " \"I find it humorous when I read the review I wrote for `Let Go' quite a while back.  In that review I mentioned how this album was a step up.  Well, upon a recent listen I've appended that statement since, well, it's not true.  As a whole `Under My Skin' is actually a step backwards from her initial album, serving up a lot more filler than necessary.  Thankfully she traded in some of her ways for a fresher sound (I still uphold that her third album is sublime) but `Under My Skin' frays towards the end to deliver an uneven album with a few goodies.So here it is, track for track.`Take Me Away' is a decent album opener, although it doesn't bring anything substantial to the table.  It showcases Avril's knack for pop/rock and the way she can nail a chorus and bring it all home, but there is something very dated about the tracks construction.  It doesn't age as well as some of her other tracks.  `Together' ages very well, standing up even today as one of her finer efforts.  The piano laden musical arrangement and Avril's vocals on the chorus are pitch-perfect.The angst-ridden `alternative-pop' scene does come over a tad `overdone' but remembering that this album was released during the genres heyday will help you appreciate what Avril attempts to accomplish here.`Don't Tell Me' was the album's first single, and it was a great choice.  I love the stripped down feel of the verses and then the `pure Avril' chorus kicks in with an added edge of earnestness.  Her vocals are distinct (like a younger, less refined Alanis Morissette) and they work marvelously here.  Sure, some of the lyrics seem simple and cheap, but she delivers them with a veneer of conviction that elevates the song.  It's still one of my favorite Avril songs.`He Wasn't' is one of the big issues I have with early Avril; she doesn't understand who she is as an artist.  The whole `let me pretend to be punk rock and release a vintage Green Dayesque record' just doesn't work with her.  The musical arrangement itself fees ripped straight from Green Day's `Insomniac' record.  `How Does It Feel' finds Avril trying to tap into the success of `I'm With You', slowing things down and trying to pull out a sincere and moving track that just doesn't do it.  It doesn't have the ghostly quality of `I'm With You', despite trying very hard to.  `My Happy Ending' was probably one of Avril's biggest hits; in fact they still play this one the radio often.  It is cheery in structure despite the downer-type message.  It is bouncy and catchy and fun.  `Nobody's Home' captures some of the eerie sincerity that `How Does It Feel' misses.  Sure, it isn't exactly the same breed of track, but it conveys the feelings that `How Does It Feel' couldn't.  Maybe that's because Avril vocals are better suited for `big' things.  She blends the slowed down appeal of a ballad with the up-tempo (if only slightly) quality of her vocal tones on the chorus.`Forgotten' works, sort of, but it certainly tries a little too hard.  `Who Knows' is bouncy and interesting yet it kind of feels like fluff.  `Fall to Pieces' is soft and underwhelming.  `Freak Out' is cheap and the musical arrangement is near plagiarism, but there is some sense of fun in the chorus.But thankfully the closing track, `Slipped Away', is everything it needed to be in order to really wrap things up well.  Her vocals are strong, the chorus hits the right notes and the haunting quality she had been striving for on some of the other tracks comes full circle here and actually accomplishes what she wanted to.In the end I can't say that I hate this album, despite the fact that a good 50% or more of it is subpar and doesn't age well.  I just have this soft spot for Avril, and when she hits her highs she really soars.  This isn't the best effort from her (the second half of this album is a steep and steady free-fall) but it is still worth a listen, or two.\",\n",
       " \"With time,this second album of Avril LaVigne's will spawn just as many hits as her 2002 debut,LET GO. I was surprised that this album is only 41 minutes in length. That's 8 minutes less than the first album. I only listened to it once since I bought it. But,it's great. Keep playing that punky music,white girl!\",\n",
       " 'Avril is not the type of person you think she is. She cant play guitar,she just strums on any chord she can, she even said so in a magizine. She cant sing either, She claims to be punk but look at her. Shes not even close, Punk died along time ago. If you want real punk music, then listen to bands like..Sex Pistols,Ramones,Clash,Dead Kennedys,Operation Ivy,Bad Religon,New York Dolls, I dont see the newer punk bands screaming out there lungs or writing lyrics that make no sense. I dont see the newer punks doing crazy things and punks were never on MTV...What are you little kids thinking these days? I am not telling you to not listen to her or anything but shes not what people think',\n",
       " \"This is the obvious work of a talented singer and songwriter in a sophomore slump.  The album is so deep into Lavigne's inner conflicts that when the final third of the album changes perspective it fails to deliver us from her despair.  Angst and pain ultimately drives Lavigne's musical ambitions, and when the music and lyrics meet in harmony the end result is rather beautiful. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen too often. My Happy Ending is her most accomplished song to date.  He wasn't, much like Sk8er boy, is the set's liveliest moment.  Sometimes, her angst comes across as mechanical: take me away, together, don't tell me, and nobody's home.  Despite the emotionless delivery of each song, Ms. Lavigne's capable of tapping into the mass' discomfort and delivering a radio smash.  Her knack for crafting pop tunes will keep her singing about inadequate sk8er bois for years to come.\",\n",
       " 'I must admit, I hated Avril\\'s first album!  At first, I had written her off as another rebellious teenage whiny brat!  Then, my roommate got me into this CD.  She\\'s really grown up a lot since Let Go.  Compared to her debut, Under My Skin is edgier, more mature, and definitely shows more of Avril\\'s deep side!  My favorite songs are Take Me Away, Together, My Happy Ending, Nobody\\'s Home, and Slipped Away!  The only song that even sounds remotely juvenile on this album is He Wasn\\'t.  But there\\'s sill something about that song that naturally makes me sing along!  And unlike another person I know, I don\\'t think the \"na na\" part of Slipped Away is immature at all!  No, I don\\'t think she\\'s punk.  But I do think this is one great album!  Even if you hated Avril before, just give it a chance!  Trust me, I too used to be a card-carrying member of the \"We Hate Avril\" club!',\n",
       " 'To be honest, while I appreciate Avril Lavigne\\'s uniqueness and feminism, I wasn\\'t that thrilled about her first album. Because that one IMO didn\\'t blend very well as a whole, some are so electric guitar hard rock, while others are juss plain pop, and some kinda gave me a big head ache...But this one is just GREAT!!!! Blended so much better and none of the songs are as pop-ish as her last one.The thing is, I just like her music in that she\\'s very unique. She wants to be aggressive, why the hell not??? Let her be aggressive and talk about flipping out men who cheat her. Her last one I felt wasn\\'t aggressive enough, but this one she just pretty much let it all out, in fact, I think Let Go would be more appropriate for this album :)I think those people who DESPERATELY tries to put her, or any unique singers for that fact, into a genre juss gets me tired, how about just call them alternative?? It\\'s easier. Avril is some punk, some rock, some pop OKAY?? stop saying things like she\\'s just a wannabe pop artist who tries to be punk, she isn\\'t really punk, she\\'s just the way she is.As for people claiming she\\'s a poser and such, well, every unique band/singer has been labeled that by some people who find their unique-ness distastful (and sadly majority are girls, I guess there is still a looooong way to go before society finally being cleaned of sexism). I don\\'t know her as a person, but I don\\'t much care. She\\'s not one of my favorite singers (being overly bashing is not exactly my thing) but I still enjoy her music, enjoy her uniqueness, and even enjoy the aggressiveness and freakish attitude.The reason this album got such a low score is because of that kid who used EVERY aliases he/she has to spam this place with 1-star ratings. If you don\\'t believe me go read them yourself, you\\'ll see that many of them are repetitive and similar, basically I-hate-rock-bands they cause a racket and Avril is just a bad girl blah blah blah, yep, happens to all singers who are popular, sad huh? Some people just NEED to spam every top artist there is.And also about the one-star review on the top (top reviewers section) who said she\\'s hypocretical. Okay first of all I checked it out, she NEVER said \"Please Cry with me\", she said, in How Does It Feel \"Would you cry with me\" which has a TOTALLY different meaning. this song I always interpret it as-I\\'m very lonley but I deal, in her lyrics she said \"I\\'m not afraid of anything, but suddenly suddenly... how does it feel to be different from me? are we the same?\" Second of all, oh geeeeez, alot of singers write about the contrasting feelings, attitudes etc, it\\'s what keeps the listeners interested, not all albums has to revolve around ONE theme you know. Alot of albums, just like hers, wrote about being cheated and being loved, being strong and being vulnerable at the same time, would you also label them as hypocretical??? Third of all anyone who actually listen CLOSELY to her songs would know she covered a VARIETY of feelings, many times conflicting, NOT ALWAYS the \"I don\\'t care if you screw me\" like in Don\\'t Tell Me. She wrote about being in love in Take Me Away(want to be with the lover), Fall To Pieces (which is actually a very girly cute falling in love theme) and Slipped away (sad that the lover is away); She wrote about being lonely in How Does It Feel and Nobody\\'s Home; Wrote about being carefree and happy in Who Knows and Freak Out; And of course, insecure love such as Together and Happy Ending. Alot of her songs she said she does care, please DO NOT judge a singer base on a few popular, radio-station-repetitively played songs.And also I never really think that an artist\\'s work would necessarily reflect the artist\\'s personality. They might be close but it is very likely that an artist just want to try something new and unheard-of. So whether Avril REALLY is like the girl in her songs, I remain doubtful.',\n",
       " 'I\\'ve always been a fan of Avril\\'s work, so when I heard she was releasing a new album, I went to the store and picked it up. While this album, Under My Skin, isn\\'t quite as good as her first album, it does have its moments of greatness.The first two songs, \"Take Me Away\" and \"Together\", are questionable, though; a shocker since the latter was co-written by Chantal Kreviazuk (by the way, check out her latest album) -- but another song Chantal helped write, \"Forgotten\", isn\\'t all that either. Oh well, there are still some good songs on here, like \"Don\\'t Tell Me\", \"Fall to Pieces\", and my personal favorite, \"My Happy Ending\". \"He Wasn\\'t\" is okay, but I think the song was better when it was called \"Sk8er Boi\".The calmer, smoother songs on here are also more accessible than they were on her first album. Like when I first heard \"I\\'m With You\", it took a while to grow on me, but the mellow songs HERE are pretty good at first listen, as evidenced by \"How Does It Feel\" and her dedication to her grandfather, \"Slipped Away\". Everything else is okay, and while this may not win Album of the Year, it\\'s still decent enough to add to your collection -- that is, if you\\'re a person who\\'s open to give it a chance instead of just telling all non-metal artists to go to Hell.Anthony Rupert',\n",
       " \"A lot of the songs on this album sound simular... Although Avril goes on TV saying the album is different than Let Go, as well as more rock'n'roll..., I think the only tracks that are somewhat rock are Take Me Away and Forgotten (which I think sounds simular to Unwanted).  All in all this is still a good effort,...but would have been better if there were more thought put into the lyrics.Recomended songs: Take Me Away, Together, Don't Tell Me, My Happy Ending, Nobody's Home, Who Knows, Freak Out, Fall To Peices, Slipped Away, I Always Get What I Want, and the Nobody's Home acoustic track.\",\n",
       " 'I liked this album a lot more than I did Avril\\'s debut C.D. \"Let Go\", mainly because it contains a much higher number of hard guitar tracks (which I think she definitely excels at). Although many people may put Avril down after hearing the slightly bland hits \"My Happy Ending\" and \"Nobody\\'s Home\", one listen to Under My Skin in its entirety makes her skills as a musician seem much more plainspoken. \"He Wasn\\'t\", for example, offers an energetic and fast-paced rock atmosphere that is great, but isn\\'t shared by any of Avril\\'s hits. The song \"Forgotten\" also helps contribute to the album\\'s solidity in that it ventures into Avril\\'s noise-loving side, blasting into forceful electric guitar and high-volumed lyrics which add some positive variety to the CD. Under My Skin also hosts the essential hit \"Don\\'t Tell Me\", which may be among my top three favorite Lavigne songs due to its unique yet splendid lyrical flow. Overall, this album has a very good sense of rock and ought to be in any Lavigne fan\\'s collection. I would also advise those who dislike the featured tunes \"My Happy Ending\" and \"Nobody\\'s Home\" to try Under My Skin out anyway, since in my opinion the non-hit tracks well exceed the quality of most of her hits.',\n",
       " \"I enjoyed her last album, so I thought I would give a listen to the second one as well.  I think it's great, it has more of a rock feel to it this time around.  Lots of great tracks, my favorites being My Happy Ending, Slipped Away, and Don't Tell Me.  I would go as far to compare her sound here to some reputable singers such as Michelle Branch and Alanis Morissette.  I could hear them a lot in Avril.  This is not a bad CD, I'm really surprised at many of the reviews here.  Give this a chance, you might like it.  I was actually wondering about it myself, but I keep an open mind to all music.\",\n",

Darby Crash &amp; the Germs would kick this little poseur's behind into the middle of next week...and then go out for a beer.She wants to be the female Sid Vicious, but comes across more like Sid Caesar!\",\n",
       " 'Contrary to what some people say, this is a solid release from Ms. Lavigne. Her writing has matured immensley from the last release and her vocals are also better than the last disc too. For her songs being mainly about love and heart ache, she wrote them extremely well. The most \"punk\" song on here is He Wasn\\'t and I admit that that song is horrendous, she doesn\\'t pull off those kind of songs very well at all. Although, the harder hitting songs are done very well, her vocals seem to compliment those kind of songs nicely. Another thing I found interesting is the diversity this album has, it takes you from rock to \"punk\" to pop to pop rock, not many cds have that kind of diversity anymore. The thing about this cd that keeps me coming back for more is that it is the kind of cd where the songs get implanted into your brain and you can\\'t get them out no matter how hard you try.A few of the best songs on here are Take Me Away, How Does It Feel, Nobody\\'s Home, and Forgotten. But like I said earlier, it\\'s the diversity that drew me to this cd, it\\'s not the type of cd I expected her to make. For that reason alone I reccommend this cd, but if that isn\\'t good enough, her vocals are amazing in my opinion. This release is definitely a big step up from the last disc.',\n",
       " \"On Avril Lavigne's freshman album she worked with production duo the Matrix, and recorded a solid album of mainly guitar-driven pop/folk/punk tracks.  Now with her sophomore album out, Avrils growth as a person both lyrically and vocally are apparent, but even more notable is the heavy influence the production teams she chooses to work with has.  Don't be mistaken, its not like Avril has done a drastic 180, in fact there are very strong parallels that can be drawn between certain tracks and sounds on this disc to her last one - but in general the album shows increased growth - from everything to the lyrics to the instrumentation of each song.&quot;Take Me Away&quot; (similar to 'Losing Grip' on her first album), &quot;Together&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Home&quot;, and &quot;Forgotten&quot; are all produced by Don Gilmore, who has worked with artists such as Linkin Park and Eve 6, and lends a heavy rock sound to these four songs.  &quot;Together&quot; features some of the strongest verses but the production on the chorus sounds cheap and abrasive at some points.  &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; is a good song lyrically about a girl who feels alone and trapped, and Avril's vocals shine here, and &quot;Forgotten&quot; is a stand-out track in terms of style as it channels gothic proportions - but isn't necessairly one of my faves.&quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; (Avrils first single, comparable to &quot;Complicated&quot; off of her first album), &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; (Her second single), and &quot;Freak Out&quot; exemplify another style, namely poppy, and probably are due to the influence of producer Butch Walker, of the late 90's band &quot;Marvelous 3&quot;.  If you haven't heard Avril's first two singles both are really awesome, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; has a good girl power message and nice production with pianos and guitars, and &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; is a really sweet heartbreak song, with an awesome hook and the video is also really good.  &quot;Freak Out&quot; is just a good sing-along anthem in general.Finally one must draw attention to the power couple of Canadian music that has heavy influence on Lavigne throughout.  Chantal Kreviazuk, Avrils &quot;new best friend&quot;, hails from my city and is best known in Canada for her cover of &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot; or one of her many hits including &quot;Now I Think I'll Get Through&quot;. Chantal co-writes half of the albums tracks, as well as injects a bit of her style with the lush layered vocals, poetic lyrics, and folky-guitars on some of the mellower tracks. Chantal's husband Raine Maida plays double duty as producer and co-writes one of the tracks (one of my personal faves lyrically) &quot;Fall To Pieces&quot;.  Maida is best known for his stint as the frontman of the super popular Canadian rock group Our Lady Peace, and lends some of his style (vocally and production-wise) to the rest of the tracks on the album.  These include the pop-punk &quot;He Wasn't&quot; (similar to &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;), the super mellow &quot;How Does It Feel&quot;, the rock-pop anthem &quot;Who Knows&quot;, and the closing track dedicated to Lavigne's grandpa who died while she was on tour.  &quot;Slipped Away&quot; is again one of the best tracks to show off Avrils vocals particularly during the raw piano accompanied parts, and is a touching end to a solid album.Altogether Avril fans new and previous, young and old, will be satisfied with this 12 song offering that explores new territory for the young singer - musically, vocally, and lyrically.  She mixes styles based on production (harder rock, pop, and a folk-rock vibe) and proves that she deserves to be in the spotlight as a still-rising singer/songwriter.\",\n",
       " \"Yah right, what are you people listening too? She doesn't have anything in common with Aerosmith, so stop comparing already. I'm Canadian, &amp; I've never heard of Rush, so no comment. This album is a hundred times better then Let Go. Let Go is an embarrassement to this. Much improvement Avril has made, she writes a lot her songs with hardly any help, she's playing guitar live now, which is awesome, before she only played for like 3 songs(Tomorrow, Naked &amp; Things I'll Never Say). Now, she's playing guitar live for almost all her songs, if not all. I saw her perform at Much last Friday, on TV that is, every new song she performed, 8 songs it was, she played guitar for except Forgotten &amp; Slipping Away she played piano. She's far more talented now, &amp; I don't know how anyone can not like this album unless you absolutely despised Avril in the 1st place, but then what's the point of listening to this then if you know you're already going to hate it. Well, here's a quick review:Take Me Away: 5/5 This song is awesome, the chorus rocks, &amp; verses are amazing.Together: 4.5/5 If you actually listen to it, the lyrics are very meaningful, the pre-chorus is my favourite part. I'm using this song for my Poetry Project in English, which is kinda cool!!Don't Tell Me: 4.5/5 Who can't love her first single? Unless you hear it so often you get sick of it. Well, I was close, until I decided to stop listening to it for a while, &amp; hey, that works. I still really love it!! Fun songHe Wasn't: 5/5 Speaking of fun songs, this is definitely one of them. I love the guitar, the chorus, everything about it!!How Does It Feel: 5/5 An cool slow song, which you don't get too often. I love this song, it's so innovative &amp; emotional. I didn't cry or anything, but it's sad &amp; cool.My Happy Ending: 4.5/5 Fun, fun, fun!~!Nobody's Home: 5/5 Very thoughtful song, this is the one I was going to use for my Poetry assignment but changed my mind at the last second, I love this song! Terrific.Forgotten: 5/5 Now this is punk!! Simply fantastic.Who Knows: 4.5/5 Outstanding!! I love it. Tells you to be  happy about life &amp; don't be afraid to take chances, something alot of people need as a confidence booster.Fall to Pieces: 4/5 I like this song, it's catchy, &amp; meaningful, only a little too personal for my likings but awesome just the same, great!!Freak Out: 5/5 NOw this is the Avril we all know &amp; love, it's time to just rock out!!Slipping Away: 5/5 But not too this song, slowest song on the album, but it is pretty!!Note: She wrote Fall to Pieces with Raine Maida(Our Lady Peace) &amp; Together/He Wasn't/How Does It Feel/Forgotten/Who Knows/Slipped Away with Chantal Kreviazuk. Also includes a free mini poster with 2 sides, ones the cover, &amp; ones just another picture of her. Very pretty!!Overall, terrific album, I look forward to hearing more of her. Somethings telling me this girl is sticking around for a while!!\",\n",

       " 'Avril Lavigne\\'s first album, LET GO, went quadruple platinum and was nominated for five Grammy Awards for 2002. Unfortunately, Norah Jones was also nominated for five--competing with Avril in several--and Norah swept her nominations, while Avril was left with none. I remember Norah was interviewed backstage and she admitted to strolling past Avril with an armful of grammies and saying something to rub salt in the wound, adding insult to injury, as it were.Avril had something going there at first with her neck ties over T-shirt look on MTV, and her anti-Britney stance. But then she had to mispronounce David Bowie\\'s name while announcing the Grammy nominations. The Lavigne backlash had begun. Next thing you know, a computer virus was named for her that forced you to go to her website. Why did things have to get so complicated?Her sophomore effort, UNDER MY SKIN, was edgier, darker, and dare I say just a little more mature? Two whole years had gone by. As I write this, there are 1,122 customer reviews of it on Amazon, with 590 giving it 5 stars while 248 haters rate it only 1 star. Both are fun to read, the raves for the over-the-top enthusiasm, the youthful spelling and grammar errors, and the heartfelt appreciation of the music; and the pans for the sour grapes, the skewering of her naivite and foibles, and the clever put-downs. I am rating it 2 stars, merely because only 32 other people chose that number, and I figure it will be easier to find. You can search the reviews by the ratings. Most people either loved or hated her, so I will be luke warm, just to stand out in the crowd.I really liked the song \"My Happy Ending.\" I heard it on the radio. I was listening to a station that plays a mix of old and new music, and though they play thousands of different songs, if they put it in the rotation you are likely to hear it 2 or 3 times in a month or so. That was enough for it to stick in my head, and make me wonder who it was. Not surprised that it was Avril, in fact she was my first guess (her song, \"Complicated\" also stuck in my head after hearing it a few times). The `happy beginning\\' goes a little like this:Lets talk this overIt\\'s not like we\\'re deadWas it something I did?Was it something you said?Don\\'t leave me hangin\\'In a city so deadHeld up so highOn such a breakable threadI really like the breakable thread image. The \"In a city so dead\" is my least favorite line. It doesn\\'t really add anything, and distracts. Why is the city so dead? The song isn\\'t really about the city, its mortality or lack thereof, and it seems like it was just inserted so the breakable thread line could rhyme with something. But I quibble. Don\\'t know if Avril wrote this herself or not, but whoever wrote it has a way with words. I also like this verse, which is almost conversational, as it spins the story along:You\\'ve got your dumb friendsI know what they sayThey tell you I\\'m difficultBut so are theyBut they don\\'t know meDo they even know you?All the things you hide from meAll the shizzle you doThe music supports the song well, with a very dramatic build up, and a rousing, though somewhat ironic, chorus:All this time you were pretendingSo much for my happy endingSo much for my happy endingFinally, due to her mispronounciation of David Bowie\\'s name, I wonder if she is even aware of the great song writers of the past such as Cole Porter, who wrote \"I\\'ve Got You Under My Skin,\" a song that was sung so well by Mr. Frank Sinatra? Was her album title a reference to it, or is she completely oblivious? I wonder, because each time I do, just the thought of you makes me stop--before I begin, `cause I\\'ve got Avril Lavigne UNDER MY SKIN.Songs for Swingin\\' Lovers!',\n",
       " \"Britney's dark rival Avril Lavigne was a &quot;Complicated&quot; girl when she hit charts with her best-selling punk/rock record Let Go.  Her new CD Under My Skin isn't nearly as a satisfying listen as most second albums seem to be (just look at Britney's Oops!...I Did It Again, which outdid its record-breaking debut).  I enjoy &quot;Take Me Away,&quot; &quot;Together,&quot; &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and &quot;My Happy Ending.&quot;  I don't understand why people are so impressed with Lavigne's songwriting skills either; they're not that poetic like Jewel's songs, just like something a girl would write in her diary it seems.  Close, Avril, but no cigar.  Let Go is still your best release!  (Note: I like Avril Lavigne's first CD a lot, I'm not just saying I don't like her second because she's Avril and likes to diss my favorite living entertainer Britney Spears.)\",\n",
       " 'I dont know what I was to expect when I picked up this album about to purchase it. I didnt think it was going to match up to the overall brilliantess of \"LET GO\", I loved every single song on that album and that has only happened 1 other time. So I got it. And when I played it, it sounded cool, the opening track \"Take me away\" and once each song flowed on to the next, I loved this album, forget about all of those negative reviews from stupid people who havent even heard the album and judge her on what she is \"posing\" as. This album is really good and really catchy! I mean that A L O T . Some lyrics may be a little under-written and the vocals arent what you call Christina Aguilera,but she isnt trying to be in -your-face SEX pop.It IS a really good album and a brilliant follow up to \"Let Go\". Technically, its like \"Let Go Part II\" both albums would be amazing if they were packaged together and released together. I am going to review each song now:1. Take Me Away.....Great start to the album 10/102.Together....... I think of this as \"Complicated Part II\" cuz if you listen to the lyrics, it is. 10/103.Don\\'t Tell Me......... good 1st single, I wouldve chosen another one. Good song .But im getting kinda tired of it. 9/104. He Wasnt....... This is one thats not amazing for me, cuz it sounds so cheerleadery but again its kinda like \"Sk8r Boi Part II\" but not AS exciting..............8/105.How Does It Feel?........ I love this song. Its so nice! 10/106.My Happy Ending........... this song is nice too and Avrils 1st swear word....Sh*t! Its nothing huge to consider though (the swear word--the song rules!) 10/107. Nobodys Home.......... Again a nice song, light rock, is a good way to put it. 10/108. Forgotten......... this is SO Evanescence!!! Its cool........ 10/109.Who Knows?......... another nice song additon to the album 9.5/1010.Fall To Pieces....... Nice. 10/1011. Freak Out........ Hmmmmmmmmmmm a slower version of Sk8r Boi? kinda..... not rocky, well it is. Kind of a \"Sk8r Boi Part III (Remix)\" yeah.  8.7/1012. Slipped Away....... OMG! I love this, this is what I call a really nice song yeah, like Britneys \"Everytime\" is an OK WAY TO describe it, of course not poppy but a nice rememberance song.............10/10Well thats it really my fave tracks are:Take Me AwayTogetherHow Does It feel?My Happy EndingForgottenNobodys HomeSlipped Away.Overall this is one album that I virtually like EVERY track of!If you are considering this, forget those annoying reviews from ppl who havent even listened to the albumSong Catchiness: 10/10 Definitley!Lyric Brilliantness: 6/10....not amazing. But very acceptableVocal Brilliantness: 8/10........ not a huge voice but one thats got an influence.So yeah I reccomend it!All you Avril haters should atleast try and make out you are a fan ands see how you like it then!',\n",
       " \"Under My Skin was Avril Lavinge's sophomore album and unlike some artists this was not a slump. The album takes on a a very dark and depressing edge that shows she is more than capable to write songs other than the likes of Skater Boi. Every song on here is great and you will only find yourself skipping the through the CD to get your favorites on it. After the release of this CD she would shed the dark themes and go for a more poppy sound for her next two albums which makes Under My Skin ever that more special. My favorites are Nobody's Home, Fall to Pieces, Take Me Away, and Who Knows.\",\n",
       " \"I don't know why everyone says this is such a bad album. I love it! I have both the American version and the UK version, which contains an extra bonus track, &quot;I Always Get What I Want&quot;.Avril's sound has definitely matured quite a lot since her last album. I'm glad she ditched hitmakers &quot;The Matrix&quot; and instead co-wrote songs on &quot;Under My Skin&quot; with her guitarist Evan Taubenfeld (tracks 1,3,11) and Indie Queen Chantal Kreviazuk (tracks 2,4,5,8,12) for example.I heard &quot;Take Me Away&quot; months ago with the release of the &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; single and loved it right away. It was definitely a great foreshadowing to the rest of the album, which carries a somewhat darker sound.In my opinion, the best tracks on this CD are &quot;Slipped Away&quot; (a poignant ballad mourning the death of her Grandfather) and the next single from the album, &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; (which was performed on 'Saturday Night Live', May 5th, 2004).This album is a must have for any punk-rock lover's collection.\",\n",
       " 'It has been a curiosity to me why Avril Lavigne has been compared with Witless Spears and \"Don\\'t\\' Call Me Britney\" Christina.  Seems to me Lavigne has always appealed to a much different audience.  If in the future Lavigne begins to perform in nothing but pasties and a thong, I may change my opinion.  Until then I suspect she is more of a rocker than a showbiz child.But this does point out one of the pitfalls of watching young girl performers turn into young women.  Examples abound of young women who feel they have something to prove once they sense they have crossed the river into the land of young adulthood.  The first thing that happens is they cut their long locks for a \"cute\" hairstyle they think makes them look more mature (usually has the ironic effect of making them look more childish).  Frills and lace give way to more revealing and provocative clothing.  Along with this follows the bejeweled navel and the \"butt-hat\" tattoo for added notes of daring.  Depending on the setting, our once precious angels will take up cussing and smoking for public consumption to strike a pose of defiance and independence.  Along with the changes in appearance and behavior, choices in songwriting strike further notes of worldliness.  \"You Can\\'t Tell Me What To Do!\"  \"I Was Such A Fool But I Know Better Now\" and the ever popular tunes which boil down to \"I\\'ve Had Sex.  Lots Of It And I Like It!\"In general we wish them well; but it would take a heart of stone not to sense there is something faintly ridiculous about this.  Communication is a highly overrated activity.  Generally a little talking goes a long way-as long as it has purpose.  Most of us, however, are given to verbal diarrhea thinking that if it is said once it bares being said a hundred times.  Failing accurate expression we let loose a verbal torrent hoping that somehow some heartfelt truth will come out.  Worse, we seem to think if we say it enough then it is true.  We shouldn\\'t be too hard on young men and woman; but neither should we take their protestations of adulthood at face value.  Most of us latter learn that in spite of all this \"noise\" maturity actually occurs when our focus begins to drift away from ourselves.  Like happiness, maturity is a by-product of a long line of accomplishments and sacrifices.In this regard, Avril Lavigne is more like Alanis Morissette than either Britney or Christina.  Like Morissette, Lavigne works in a rock and roll idiom where the music says as much if not more as the actual lyrics.  This works in her favor in that reading the lyric sheet makes one feel like you are reading the diary of a hyperventilating high school girl.  We are related tales of failed loves, loneliness, and new loves.  Concerning lost loves we see that from her point of view it wasn\\'t just that the love failed: injustice was done to her.  Either the former lover was not who she thought he was or he turned out to be a jerk.  In any event, Lavigne is desperate for love and it is that very desperation that gets her into so much trouble.The more cynical among us would say that so it is with all of us-older, more sophisticated folk just dress it up better.  Maybe so.  As music, Lavigne has nothing to be ashamed of.  Each song here has its moments of greatness and appeal.  That the guitar lines and rhythms are obviously beyond Lavigne\\'s own abilities should not be held against her.  Rather it more directly speaks to knowing who to collaborate with to make the music she wants.  The music also has the virtue of not sounding like something out of a \"rockin\\'-r-us\" computer program.  Instead it has stylistic idiosyncrasies and expressions that breathe \"originality\" into all twelve songs to catch your notice and perhaps grudging admiration.Lavigne just may pass into musical adulthood without embarrassing herself.  Whatever her faults, her instincts are good and sound.  In recent interviews, Lavigne badmouths Britney and Christina.  Good move.  Here hoping she doesn\\'t someday admit to secretly wanting to be like Madonna.',\n",
       " \"Yep.  That Sk8er girl has matured a little bit...LET GO was flashy and radio friendly (but good), but this album's a little on the dark side (but still good).From the confessional &quot;How Does it Feel&quot; to the moving &quot;Slipped Away&quot; to the in-your-face &quot;Freak Out&quot;, this album covers a wide spectrum of musical tastes and subjects.  Still popish, but with an edge, UNDER MY SKIN will grab your ears and take them for a ride.It's almost universally understood that Avril Lavigne is a talent; you may not like her style, but you got to hand it to her--she writes lyrics like that should be written.  The songs on this album are often emotionally charged (&quot;Take Me Away&quot;, &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot;) and sometimes daring (&quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; basically advocates virginity).  However, they're all of top-quality, delivered by a young woman who's beginning to appeal to adults as well as precocious fourteen-year-old girls.The anti-Brittany, Avril Lavigne is a standout.  Everybody's copying her, and she may have copied a few people, but she is unique.  UNDER MY SKIN is a definite must-have for music fans...even those of you who are &quot;anti-Avril&quot;.  In the words of the great Kris Kristofferson: You're the only one that you are screwing, when you put down what you don't understand.  Take it to heart, and just buy the damn record.\",\n",
       " \"Following up a smash hit debut album is possibly harder than getting that first magical recording contract in the first place - the artist oftentimes feels he/she must outdo himself/herself, and fans oftentimes resist any deviation from what has come before.  Many young artists crash and burn, never to be heard from again.  Avril Lavigne is not among those, and with this really quite incredible sophomore release she cements her place in the present and future of the music industry.  While there are echoes of Let Go to be found here, I found this to be a surprisingly different album from its predecessor - the artist has grown as a person, a musician, and a song writer, and the expanding life experiences of this remarkably talented teenager have infused her music with a palpable sense of something quite real and deep that speaks volumes to the listener.I have been listening to this album constantly since it came out (and I might mention Avril Lavigne is one of the few artists whose new album I simply had to purchase as soon as it was released), and I can't find a bad song on here.  Not only is this a five-star album, it is a collection of twelve five-star songs, in my opinion.  I have a sentimental attachment to many of the songs from Let Go, but as a whole this new album is a much more impressive offering.  Avril co-wrote each of these songs, and as far as I'm concerned, the doubts some voice about her song-writing abilities are quite misplaced.  The first single, Don't Tell Me, is a great song and in some ways it forms a natural bridge from the first album to the second, but it is far from the best song on the album.  Take Me Away starts Under My Skin off with a bang; there's no gradual immersion into this new album, as Avril reaches out and yanks you by the collar from the very start.  Then comes Together, which I love; teen angst fuels the fire of this song, and the manner in which Avril delivers the chorus of this song really appeals to me.  He Wasn't is a fantastic song of independence and self-worth; its up-tempo delivery has a Green Day feel to it, and the song itself is all about not settling for anything less than the best.How Does It Feel is the only track that didn't win me over immediately, and at first I wasn't sure there was really much to this song; over time, though, I have come to appreciate and love its comparatively simple style and delivery.  In this song as well as the album's final track, Avril seems to step away from the bold and brash persona she carries so well to reveal a little bit of her soul.  My Happy Ending has hit single written all over it; this song of dreams unfulfilled sweeps a vast panorama of the singer's soul, as she moves back and forth between regret at what has been lost and inspiring defiance at the wrong that has been done.  This theme is reinforced by Nobody's Home, the subject of which lacks such inner strength, and Fall to Pieces sort of falls under the same broad theme.  I think Forgotten might be my favorite song on the album, as it gives us Avril at her most fiery and determined - when she says she won't be forgotten again, she really means it.If you're looking for strong shades of Let Go, I think you'll want to direct your attention to Who Knows and Freak Out; these are tracks of great energy and pace, speaking ably to Avril's amazing mesh of inner strength, confidence, and vulnerability.  Slipped Away closes the album out quite impressively.  Dedicated to the memory of Avril's grandfather, Slipped Away is a moving tribute to a loved one who has been lost.And there you have it: twelve great songs on one very impressive album.  Let no one doubt that Avril Lavigne will be a forceful and innovative force in music for some time to come.\",\n",
       " '\"Under My Skin\" may not be as good as Avril Lavigne\\'s first album overall, but there are some strong pieces here and it is not too big of a drop from her debut.  In particular the slower pieces are weak by comparison with her first album, and there isn\\'t as much diversity in sound.  This album was released on May 24th, almost exactly two years after her debut, and almost three years prior to her third album.The album opens with some good tracks.  \"Take Me Away\" has got a good edge to it, though the lyrics are a bit vague.  It leads well into \"Together\" another solid piece, though it isn\\'t quite as good as \"Take Me Away\" in my opinion.  \"Don\\'t Tell Me\" is the first single from the album, and it has a good strong message for young teen girls about not letting boys pressure them into going farther than they want to.  \"He Wasn\\'t\" is about a failed relationship, which fits right into a good portion of this album.  It has a catchy chorus, but it is probably the weakest of the opening four pieces and yet still fairly good.  \"How Does It Feel\" is the first example of the weaker slow songs.  It is fairly forgettable overall.  \"My Happy Ending\" is my personal favorite on the album, and a good closer for the first half of the album.\"Nobody\\'s Home\" opens the second half of the album, another good piece.  The video focuses on the idea of being homeless, but one can also take the lyrics as emotional isolation.  \"Forgotten\" starts a bit slow and soft, but the sound builds through the first chorus.  It adds a bit of diversity in sound with its different approach, but it isn\\'t anything special.  \"Who Knows\" is another decent piece, but nothing especially memorable, and a few too many repeats of the word \"yeah\" making it almost sound like a parity of herself in parts.  \"Fall to Pieces\" is another weaker song on the album, good for one listen, but not something I would listen to over and over again and lyrically it is fairly weak.  \"Freak Out\" is a nice return to some rock.  Ultimately it isn\\'t as good as the best tracks on the album, but it benefits from its placement after several weaker pieces.  \"Slipped Away\" is another weak slow song, though perhaps the best of those available, which isn\\'t saying a lot.This album has several good pieces, but overall it doesn\\'t hang together as well as her first album.  It lacks the diversity of the first album, and what little it has tends to be in the weaker efforts on the album.  The first half is significantly better than the second half, and even though this is a step backward for her, it is still a bit above average as far as albums go.',\n",
       " \"After reading a lot of very negative reviews on this album, I thought I should hate this album, but I love it and it's hard to say why.  Okay, so maybe Avril is sleazy and greasy and seldom bathes, as one reviewer said.  What difference does it make on a sound CD?  Madonna was very slutty and sleazy at times, but she could sing very well and was extremely popular.  Avril can also sing quite well.  Maybe these aren't great songs and maybe it does sound like she is shouting the lyrics at times or that all the songs sound alike or that the songs are somewhat negative.  It doesn't matter; it's still a very enjoyable album.  There is just something about it that makes it better than average  It has some pizazz, which a lot of albums these days don't.  Avril is fully as good or better than the other teenie booper singers like Brittany Spears or Hillary Duff.  I tried to listen to the LET GO album and it just didn't do for me what this one does.Avril has a bit of an edge or roughness to her voice, which doesn't make it as sweet as some of the other young female singers, but I think that's part of the appeal.  No one particular song stands out on this album as better than any other.  One thing that is clearly demonstrated is that Avril can handle slow and fast songs equally well.  Remarkably good effort for someone just starting out.  It will be interesting to see how Avril evolves and whether she improves or just slips into obscurity.\",\n",
       " \"When I first heard her new single &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; it caught my attention then I heard her 2nd single &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; and I loved that song as well... so I came on here to hear some sound samples to see what else the cd had to offer out of those the songs that stuck out the most were track (1)&quot;Take Me Away&quot; and track (2)&quot;Together&quot; so I got the cd and my favorite songs from what I did not hear previously were track (9)&quot;Who Knows&quot; and track (10) &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot;.  I really do enjoy this cd the other songs are good but it takes you a little bit to adjust to the style the rest of the songs will grow on you more as you play it.  and I now enjoy the whole cd... so if you like the songs I listed you will most likely like the rest of the cd.  And for all you who are saying oh she thinks shes punk or what not...No there is a reason she comes up under pop artists when you do the search and if you buy this looking for some punk type music you will be disappointed and you should know that it's going to be poppish because for one her previous album gives you an idea on what to expect and for 2 she comes up in the search under other pop artists and she is anti Britney Spears and Christina because though her music is of the pop genere she stays true to the way she is and doesn't dress like they do.  So with that I give this cd 4 stars do to the fact that I had to give the rest of the songs a few listens, but like I said I now enjoy the whole cd and listen to it often..So don't hesitate on picking this one up.\",\n",
       " 'I remember this album when I was in the 11th grade. I love this album and still play it LOUD!! The songs on this album are deeper than her debut. Under My Skin opens with the dramatic tracks \"Take Me Away: and \"Together\",which set the scene for the [...] guitars and radio-ready chorus of \"Don\\'t Tell Me\\' which picks up where \"Complicated\" left off. From there it\\'s a 1-2 punch of 3-chord guitar licks and head-bopping optimism alongside swirling melodies and moody tracks that reveal a darker side of Avril. This album has been certified 2x Platinum. Remember,this was 2004-2005.',\n",
       " \"I have the japenese version of this album.It has two extra songs:-i always get what i want and nobody's home live acoustic.my favorites are:-take me away,don't tell me,he wasn't,my happy ending and freak out.this album rocks,buy it now and you won't be dissapointed.\",\n",
       " \"Avril Lavigne doesn't really adjust her attitude for &quot;Under My Skin&quot; -- she still comes across as the kid sister from a safe suburban family, who's in that &quot;I'm dark and edgy, bad grrl me!&quot; phase. In her sophmore album, she stays on familiar turf with recycled guitar pop and limp songwriting.Things don't kick off to a good start with a bit of messy synth, and the announcement &quot;I cannot find a way to describe it&quot; at the start of &quot;Take Me Away.&quot; Following it is the raggedly cliched &quot;Together,&quot; the bouncy you-let-me-down &quot;My Happy Ending,&quot; light rock &quot;Nobody's Home,&quot; and the chest-beating &quot;Freak Out.&quot; Most overrated is the tepid, poppy &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; a mix of abstinence and girl-power anthem that doesn't live up to its promise.The general themes are pretty much the same -- she's been let down in affairs of the heart, and she's a tough, unafraid, does-her-own-thing rock chick. Neither is particularly heartfelt -- she insists that she doesn't care, that she's strong and isn't afraid, then puts out helpless cries of &quot;Please cry with me&quot; and &quot;I can't handle this confusion.&quot; Be vulnerable or tough, but make up your mind.Lavigne's voice is pretty much standard pop stuff -- she can hold a note, but can't make it rise, and her voice is suited to the tepid guitar pop that is played behind her. The music itself is pop masquerading as rock -- dig down past the electric guitars and limp basslines, and you'll find basic, repetitive pop rhythms. It's fairly catchy, but almost instantly forgettable.Lavigne actually pens some of the songs solo this time around, although most are cowritten with songwriting team the Matrix. Unfortunately, neither solo or cowritten songs are much good. &quot;Na na,&quot; &quot;ah ah&quot; and &quot;oh oh&quot; are written in as part of the lyrics, which include such gems as &quot;Walk around with my hands/up in the air/cause I don't care&quot; and the cringingly awful &quot;How does it feel to be/different from me?&quot; MTV pop poetry doesn't get much more insightful than that.Teen pop queen Avril Lavigne still wavers helplessly between vulnerability and I'm-a-tough-girl-don't-mess-with-me, all behind a wall of canned guitar pop and tepid songwriting. It gets &quot;Under My Skin,&quot; all right... like a splinter.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve finished reading almost all the reviews here and I must say that I\\'m very disgusted of people who say she\\'s the queen of punk, or created this \"Emo\", or one of the best guitar players, etc.This music isn\\'t even heavy, the guitars are barely heard, and if we can hear them Avril is one of the WORST guitarists ever, she barely plays 2 chords and plays only in the choruses. And I can\\'t stand her voice, it sound like a 4 years old girl who is crying because her mom didn\\'t buy for her a lollipop as she asked. And she\\'s not even hot, her face looks like a squashed mouse. in general there is nothing good about this waste of plastic but it is better than her terrible and overrated debut.Oh, don\\'t let MTV Rocks\\' review fool you, he/she is influenced by the worst channel on TV in the whole world, eMpTyV, and I\\'m not the first one who called it like this.  If you want real punk listen to Black Flag, Ramones, The Clash, Vibrators etc.And that\\'s what I have to say to Lavinge and eMpTyV organizationIJOS DE PUTAS!!!!That\\'s in spanish, I bet that none of you stupid Poser Lavigne fans know what its meaning.',\n",
       " 'Just wanted to address something real quick: I read on amiannoying.com (great site, BTW) that Avril called her fans a bunch of losers for \"copying her style\". Yeah, real sharp, Avril. This is what its come to. To Avril, as long as the unwashed masses keep buying into her schlop, and she gets more millions coming in, she\\'s fine. Talk about biting the hand that feeds.Avril here, Ashlee Simpson, etc. not only are horrible \"artists\", but they obviously show absolute zero respect for their fans. This just makes me miss Dimebag Darrell (RIP) even more, because he obviously loved his fans so much. He would go back and party with them as if they were old friends. Now we have Avril Lavigne calling all the 13-year-old pre-teen girls buying into her junk \"losers\". (Actually, she may have a point...)As for the music itself, or, more importantly, whether she\\'s \"punk\" or not... related searches for \"Avril Lavigne\" include \"Britney Spears\". \\'Nuff said.',\n",
       " \"&quot;Inconnu&quot; by Zen Sauvage is one of the most solid works I've ever heard from an artist. While it would be easy to pin this album under the glitch aesthetic, there's an expansive, organic undercurrent that keeps this album from being a workout in funny noises. Muted analog beats drive slowly under vast washes of decayed house synth lines in the most natural of fashions. For moments, you forget this is an electronic album. Imagine Biosphere's &quot;Cirque&quot; at a more glacial pace. Best of all, the album is free. &quot;Inconnu&quot; is the sounds of life, the common and the strange. People are just a form of ant, the clouds orchestrate the mood the day, the drone orchestra of wind rattling through the trees, and the subtle realization there's so much being missed.So where does this leave Avril Lavigne, you might ask? I don't care. I'd rather write a review of an album worth my time. This crap is low, even by teenage girl pop standards. Don't settle with this mediocrity. I beg of you to go buy an album of an artist you've never heard. Download the one I mentioned above from the Internet, it's free and actually dares to stimulate a form of higher thought in the individual. Avril Lavigne, well, we get a song about her not giving up her, uh, virginity. Yeah... umm... I hate you, Avril.The album cover for this one says everything for me: Avril is a dull shade of gray in a vivid technicolor universe.\",\n",
       " 'Avril Lavigne is back with her sophmore album titled as \"Under My Skin\". This strays away from her first debuted album \"Let Go\" from a poppish teeny rock girl to a young woman dealing with love,heartache and truth. From commercial songs as \"Don\\'t Tell Me\" and \"My Happy Ending\", she overturns her poppish-punk  side to more heartfelt realistic rock sounds to \"Forgotten\", \"Fall To Pieces\", and so many others. I can listen to this whole album without really skipping any tracks.  Either way it is worth the buy.',\n",
       " 'I\\'m sure many people wondered what happened to Avril Lavigne after her 2002 debut, \"Let Go\". She had a great deal of success with her singles and her debut in general which was a good thing considering how entertaining her album was. Just when some people were beginning to think that Avril would be a one-album-wonder, she struck back with a sophomore album, \"Under My Skin\". Compared to her debut, \"Under My Skin\" is much darker and deeper. Avril wrote or co-wrote every song and enlisted the help of Chantal Kreviazuk, bandmate Evan Taubenfeld and former Evanscence co-founder, Ben Moody. The result was an even better pop-rock offering. Avril is still in no way a punk artist nor is she pure pop or pure rock. Despite how you categorize her, this album is definitely worth a listen and may even surprise some.The album opens with a song that is probably as far from the style of \"Let Go\" as possible. With lyrics written by Avril herself, \"Take Me Away\" starts the album off with angsty pop-rock that works. While it is not the best song on the album per se, it is still an awesome song and better than most  pop-rock songs out there. \"Together\", the first song that was co-written by Chantal Kreviazuk, follows. It\\'s simpler lyrically but still a personal favourite. The song describes how Avril feels better when she is by herself than when she is with her man. The subject matter is slightly overused but the style more than makes up for it. Next up is the first single, \"Don\\'t Tell Me\". It has a more mature message than, say, \"Sk8r Boi\". This song is about a boyfriend who keeps pressuring Avril to sleep with him but she refuses. At first, I didn\\'t like this song as much as I liked Avril\\'s other singles, but it quickly grew on me.\"He Wasn\\'t\" is a favourite among fans, probably because it\\'s closer to the style of Avril\\'s debt. Many people compared it to \"Sk8r Boi\" but I do not see the resemblance. This song was produced by Raine Maida of Our Lady Peace, and co-written by Chantal Kreviazuk but unfortunately its lyrics are much weaker than other songs on the album. (\"This is where I start to bite my nails, and clean my room when all else fails\"). It is a fun song, but we know that Avril can to better. \"How Does It Feel\" is much mellower and while many complain that it has weak lyrics (\"How does it feel to be, different from me?\") I think they actually suit the song quite well. This was also co-written by Chantal Kreviazuk and Avril sounds great at this calmer style. A personal favourite, and the second single, \"My Happy Ending\" is up next. Lyrically, it\\'s one of the best songs on the album and Avril sounds genuinely angry. The bridge in particular sounds great although the vocals throughout the song are remarkable.Possibly the strongest song on the album, co-written by Ben Moody (formerly of Evanescence), follows and is entitled \"Nobody\\'s Home\". This song is nothing short of deep and I was surprised to find out that Avril wrote the lyrics all on her own. The lyrics are descriptive and melancholy yet beautiful and touching at the same time. Though simple in places, they express the meaning of the song exceptionally. The next track, \"Forgotten\" has the same feel as \"Unwanted\" off of Avril\\'s debut. Also co-written by Chantal Kreviazuk, this song has a more angsty feel. The lyrics aren\\'t quite as strong however that may be because it was placed after the two best songs on the album. Avril\\'s vocals are a little more subdued in this song, giving more of a grudging vibe rather than straight anger. \"Who Knows\" could have been great, but suffers due to a weak chorus. The verses are well-written and the chorus tries hard to be inspiring (\"Who knows what could happen, do what you do just keep on laughing\"). Unfortunately, the inspiration comes across as trite and forced and Avril would have been better off continuing the song in the same vein as the verses.\"Fall To Pieces\" is similar to \"How Does It Feel\" in the sense that it has simple lyrics that express the meaning of the song impeccably. This song was co-written by Raine Maida and it is Avril\\'s delivery that makes the lyrics work. It is a nice change to hear Avril sing a sweet love song though she never goes so far as to lose her usual style (which is a good thing). \"Freak Out\" is probably my least favourite song on the album simply because it seems out of place. Whereas many of the other songs showed some depth and meaning, this one settles for being upbeat and catchy. We already know Avril can manage this style and it sounds like this song was more suited for \"Let Go\". \"This song is dedicated in loving memory to my Grandpa\" is written above the lyrics to the final song, \"Slipped Away\". This song is a sweet, emotional piano ballad that, obviously, is about the death of Avril\\'s grandfather. While the lyrics are simple, they are expressive and you can really feel Avril\\'s grief.Overall Mark: 4.5/5While some listeners may still be caught up on the fact that Avril is not a punk singer as most people think she should be, Avril really proves herself a competent writer and singer with her second offering. As much as I enjoyed her debut, this album is even better simply because of the improvement in the lyrics. Avril seems more at home on this album and as a result, she suits the songs far better. A couple of songs suffer from weak choruses but Avril can usually make it work for the best. Personally, I would be happy if she continued working with Chantal Kreviazuk and Ben Moody as they usually bring out her best work.',\n",
       " \"The latest album from Avril Lavigne, an &quot;artist&quot; that was put on a pedestal by the media the second that she arrived on the scene.  Without her, we wouldn't have such &quot;profound&quot; lyrics as &quot;He's just a sk8er boi / She said see you later, boy&quot; and &quot;I'm not the milk and Cheerios in your spoon&quot;.  And you have to love her affected angst whenever she's on television, in her misguided attempts to prove to us how &quot;hardcore&quot; she is.  I can't wait to see her in concert with Simple Plan - I'm sure the mosh pit is going to be the most brutal one in the history of punk rock!All kidding aside, Under My Skin is Lavigne's second album, and instead of collaborating with those corporate hacks of The Matrix, she opted to work alongside Raine Maida (frontman of Our Lady Peace) and Chantal Kreviazuk, among others.  However, upon listening to this album, one wonders about the nature of the contributions from these talented songwriters; all it takes is one listen to see how flawed the songwriting is, and Lavigne's flat voice doesn't help matters much at all.  And for some reason, she continues to pronounce all of her &quot;s&quot; sounds like &quot;sh&quot; - i.e. &quot;Guys are sure hard to trussht&quot;, &quot;I'll have to kick your ash&quot;.Surprisingly, Lavigne seems to have the critics in her corner with this album, as many have commented on how she &quot;bares her soul&quot; with Under My Skin.  This much I'll give her credit for - there is nothing as embarrassingly juvenile as &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; on this album.  But there is also nothing that lends any validity to Lavigne's claims of being a &quot;hardcore punk&quot; on this album either - it's filled with the same tame, docile teen pop/rock found on her last album.  If anything, the sound of this album is even more controlled and safe than the last album, if that's possible.  The album sounds like the work of an innocent girl in her early teens, which is in contradiction with the image that Lavigne portrays.The songwriting is where this album really falls apart.  Examples: &quot;It's there inside / All I do is hide / I wish that it would just go away&quot; (&quot;Take Me Away&quot;), &quot;You held my hand and walked me home / I know / While you gave me that kiss / It was something like this / It made me go ohh ohh ... Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you / This ti-e-i-e-ime&quot; (&quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;), &quot;This is when I start to bite my nails / And clean my room when all else fails / I think it's time for me to bail&quot; (&quot;He Wasn't&quot;).  Keep in mind that I'm only scratching the surface here - this style of writing is the general rule rather than the exception.In summary: Another lackluster effort from one of the most overrated acts in the music industry.  Lavigne fails to impress with Under My Skin, a very ordinary, unspectacular collection of pop/rock lacking any kind of depth or substance.  Don't fall for all of the publicity that Lavigne and this album have received - this album is not worth your time.\",\n",
       " \"I thought Avril's first album was a refreshing change of pace from the oversaturation of pop princesses we were suffering from at the time of its release.  I liked 'Complicated,' and loved 'I'm With You.'  With this new second release, Avril doesn't stray from the formula of the first CD.  She goes at it again, but this time with a bit more finesse.Fans will be glad to know that she hasn't abandoned the style she worked in the first release.  She's remained relatively unchanged, as a matter of fact, except that she's become a bit more sophisticated with her songwriting.Unlike Dido's sophomore release, which was a bit redundant, Avril manages to maintain the same feel and vibe without sacrificing ingenuity.  It manages to stay fresh without too much change.This album could easily be titled, &quot;Let Go: The Sequel.&quot;  The first single, 'Don't Tell Me' sounds like it could be the sequel to 'Complicated,' and 'My Happy Ending' sounds like the flip side to 'I'm With You.'  I'm not asserting that Avril wrote and recorded the new songs to be follow-ups to any of her older stuff.  The songs are undeniably written by the Avril we got to know from 'Let Go,' but this time with a few more life experiences under her belt, it seems.Avril's fans should be pleased that she's remained relatively unchanged.  Older fans will be glad to know that despite this, she's still managed to grow.\",\n",
       " \"this cd ROCKS...although i don't understand why &quot;Let Go&quot; was compared to Alanis Morissette's &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;...I think this cd is more along the lines of JLP.  it's a bit more edgy, and rocky.  And Avril contributed to it a bit more...Overall, I think it's better and less poppy than Let Go.  Pick it up\",\n",
       " \"I like this cd much better than her first release.  Avril rocks on this cd with songs such as..Don't tell me, Take me away and Freak out. I love Avril's melodic sound and powerfull voice.\",\n",
       " \"I like Avril's music. It's catchy and has the correct amount of guitars and drums for a minor rock-out for those of us not too keen on listening to guys yell and pout and scream the entire album. Compared to Let Go, the lyrics are a bit the same, but the melodies are more mature and darker than Let Go, but where Let Go was filled with possible radio hits, Under My Skin is harder to pin down. With each spin, I find myself discovering that I like one particular song, only to have myself discarding that one in favor of another. Because of this, Avril's fans from her first album may have a hard time listening to Under My Skin because it's less radio/single friendly. But ultimately, Under My Skin falls flat beneath Avril's still less than sophisticated songwriting and her juxtaposing image--is she a rebel with a message or is she just another teenage/young twentysomething woman writing about her bad ex-boyfriends? But it's a fair effort from Avril, and I do look forward to seeing her mature in her music.\",\n",
       " 'Overall, it\\'s a decent disc. As I sit here listening to it again, I\\'m still really big on the sixth track, \"My Happy Ending.\" It\\'s the best song on the disc, with a catchy chorus, some great hooks and a song that fits her voice style.That is one of my biggest complaints with this CD. Avril Lavigne can\\'t really sing. Hence, a lot of the songs sound alike. If you like her voice and the scratchiness/strain of some of her vocals, you will fall in love with this CD. She frequently sounds like she\\'s whining on the higher vocals, but the grittiness of her style shines in some of the songs (\"He Wasn\\'t,\" the single \"Don\\'t Tell Me,\" \"Freak Out\").Lyrically, which is what I really look for in music, the disc is a mixed bag. Highlights are \"My Happy Ending,\" \"How Does it Feel,\" and \"Who Knows.\" Though still laced with cliche, these are probably the strongest lyrically. Sophomoric efforts include the single \"Don\\'t Tell Me,\" \"Freak Out,\" and \"Take Me Away.\" I mean, honestly: \"I cannot find a way to describe it, it\\'s there inside, all I do is hide, I wish it would just go away, what would you do if you knew\"--how many times have we heard these lyrics? You know those wonderful moments when a lyricist puts a brilliant new spin on a traditional phrase and you\\'re so thankful you got to hear the song? No such moments are in this disc. I do like \"Happy Ending\" because of the spin it puts on the traditional fairy tale phrase. \"How Does it Feel\" is a tad more mature, doesn\\'t sound so whiny (but you know, as I listen to it, it\\'s pretty stinking cliche too...all the way through it)...and \"Who Knows,\" while cliche, has some nice moments. Gosh, who am I kidding? Every song has very cliche pathetic moments lyrically.My real question is, how many na-na\\'s, hey, hey, hey\\'s, and oh-oh\\'s can you cram into a 40 minute disc? I think she may be attempting to discover that answer...Avril is out there battling with the artists who are stripping and singing about how sexual they are. Avril isn\\'t doing it. I appreciate that. I appreciate that her first single is about the opposite; that a lot of her songs are boy-bashing and honest, almost innocent.That is probably the flaw lyrically. It\\'s borderline innocent and immature but desires to be more mature. But I was genuinely surprised at the hearfelt \"Slipped Away\" dedicated to her grandfather.This isn\\'t a no-skip disc, but there are some highly listenable songs that you\\'ll be flipping to for days to come. I\\'m still not an Avril fan, but you have to give the girl some props for writing her own songs (even if they are, well, in my opinion, SAD lyrically) and just doing her thing in the midst of everyone else.I\\'ll be sick of her soon, but for now, it\\'s some fun new pop music.',\n",

I am not sure the album shows much growth from her last album but it was good too, and Avril is in pretty uncharted waters here anyways....as most of her counterparts are less rock, and more bubble gum.

       " 'This album is where a mellow pop teenager turns into a dark almost gothic rocker. Perfectly layered and blende tracks that will remain the bulk of her repetoire for the next century. From the upbeat and uplifting \"Complicated\" two years ago she turns into a darker more appealing musician. \"Together\" is a contrast that blitzes any song at the moment. She has had 2 years to mature get out of school and make good music. Heck this record is addictive. We saw \"Skater Boi\" blitz the charts, \"Don\\'t Tell Me\" is following in its footsteps. Every song strangely has a lyrical morale but I like that in music. Without the Matrix she has made a modern musical classic.',\n",
       " \"a more edgy style than her brilliant debut &quot;Let Go&quot; but still has the Avril Touch as I like to call it. I thought &quot;Let Go&quot; was a stand-out album - from the beautiful, warming &quot;I'm With You&quot;, to the story-telling rock song &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;. Some songs on this album lack proper personality - the blunt &quot;He Wasn't&quot; is one example. The songs I enjoyed the best were &quot;Take Me Away&quot; &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; &quot;Forgotten&quot; and &quot;Fall To Pieces&quot;. &quot;Forgotten is such an amazing song I must play it over and over. &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; is one that everyone loves - and everyone knows. amd &quot;Take Me Away&quot; brings you to a rockier side of Avril than ever before. I was dispointed by the bonus track &quot;I Always Get What I Want&quot; as everyone kept telling me that the song was a stand-out but I thought it was whiney, bratty nonsense.PS: Avril said on an interview that the singles from this album will be &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; &quot;Take Me Away&quot; &quot;Together&quot; and &quot;Fall To Pieces&quot;.\",\n",
       " \"Avril Lavigne definitely grew up as a performer with this CD. The cliche lyrics that sound like a transcription of anyone's diary into pseudopunk are only present in two or three songs. A lot of the improvement is probably due to the recruitment of experienced pop singer songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk (whose CDs you should definitely check out if you like this one). The MTV teen crowd that loved her first CD will probably not be as tuned: there is more mature stuff in the vein of Losing my grip or I'm with you and less mindless shouting like the one in Sk8r boi. Probably those who have grown along with her and that have outgrown the punk-supposed to be anti-Britney of the first Avril will enjoy this CD more. Also, this CD is more appealing to grown up audiences, the songwriting in some cases is remarkable. I guess that this CD is the first step for Avril to go beyond her ephemeral MTV persona and become a respectable performer. I wish her third CD move more into that direction so she can produce a 5 star album.\",\n",

       " \"For all the naysayers of Avril's last album: you might want to think about her again.  This album is really much better than the last one, in my opinion.  I listened to it for the first time today, and I really enjoyed it.  The absence of the Matrix as her production team really doesn't hurt her material or the overall sound of the record.  I especially liked TOGETHER, TAKE ME AWAY, and of course, DON'T TELL ME.  The lyrics seem much more mature than the last album which indicates that Avril is growing as an artist and as a person.  She may be punk and anti-Britney, but she sure is good at what she does best:  collecting the angst and darker side of the teen experience into a record that everyone can appreciate and enjoy.\",\n",
       " 'Out of the 4 Avril CDs (Let It Go, \"acoustic EP,\" Best D... Thing) her 2nd release, Under My Skin, is my least favorite. However, that\\'s not at all saying this is not an excellent package, it just shows how great her entire output is and that she gives herself some very stiff competition. I highly recommend the special edition with the DVD, because that\\'s a very cool addition with a lot of insight to Avril\\'s life on tour and really worthwhile interviews and footage. I like the DVD included with this package better than the DVD that comes with The Best D... Thing package (although that one is very good also). If you\\'re an Avril fan like me, you need to have all of her albums and Under My Skin is no exception. Avril is much more than a record-company-product. In fact, she\\'s not that at all. Avril is the real deal- she\\'s a multi-instrumentalist, a fantastic songwriter, an amazing singer (who doesn\\'t need to use computers to fix her vocals), and a high-energy performer. The DVD lets fans see that she\\'s also fairly grounded, and a professional musician. I think she will be around for a long time even if her popularity fades I bet she will be making good music for years to come. Just as a side note, I\\'m not in what I believe is Avril\\'s target demographic. I am a 36 year old male musician, who listens to a lot of classic rock and heavy metal. I don\\'t listen to commercial radio or even have MTV. I got into Avril after hearing a mostly acoustic concert she did, then I started buying her CDs and every one has been really good. My favorite tracks on Under My Skin include: Take Me Away, He Wasn\\'t, Happy Ending, Nobody\\'s Home. The bonus DVD alone makes this worth buying for Avril fans.',\n",
       " 'Avril Lavinge released UNDER MY SKIN, her long awaited second Mainstream album, in the Spring of 2004. Airplay promoted this record like crazy, and rightfully so. UNDER MY SKIN is an even better piece of work than Avril\\'s debut. Her voice had matured and so had her sound. This record still has that bubbly feel with her lyrics in dealing with relationships, but the contour and Avril\\'s sound is darker. This aspect adds even more artistic quality to the album and it is a trait that coinsides perfectly with Avril\\'s older and more mature style. Once again, Avril jumps from instrument to instrument within her band\\'s rhythm section, but of course her voice is the one melodic instrument she can\\'t get away from. A typical rhythm section along with numerous effects backs up the nineteen year old, and the product is one that can only be described as: Avril\\'s. And that\\'s a statement that any proud musician would want to receive from a listener. UNDER MY SKIN is a unique piece of work and one that is worth hearing.Stand out tracks include:\"He Wasn\\'t\"\"How Does It Feel\"\"My Happy Ending\"\"Forgotten\"\"Fall To Pieces\"\"Slipped Away\"',\n",
       " 'When Avril Lavigne burst onto the scene two years ago with \"Let Go\" and it\\'s accompaning radio-deluged songs like \"Complicated,\" \"Sk8ter Boi\" and \"I\\'m With You\" she was touted to be the new model of teen agnst. Part of the reason that she still had success was not only because the young could identify with the image she had, her music was also catchily enjoyable to listen to.Her second album has continued that formula albiet in to a varying degree. She brings to arm her anger but also has an introspective soul, covering issues such as abstiance, loss, revenge, obsession and lost love. But in doing so, the magical touch of the music that was present on her first album is somewhat diminished.While this album is fun to listen to, there is not a single song on here that has the instant hook that was on her first album. The first time we heard \"Complicated\" two years ago we knew this was something different. Now we get a very diluted version with the first single \"Don\\'t Tell Me,\" a song that manages to cover the issue of abstaining from teen sex in a time when teen pregnancies are on the rise. A touchy issue that comes across well lyrically but again, musically is brings back to much of \"Complicated.\"Lavigne borrows too much of popular acts to be called innovative - \"Take Me Away\" and \"Together\" are rockers that instantly recall the sounds of Evanecense, \"He Wasn\\'t\" is another fast paced version of \"He Wasn\\'t\" and some of the slower songs like \"Forgotten,\" How Does It Feel\" and Slipped Away\" fade into the background upon repeated listenings. Not because an important messege is not there - Slipped Away deals with the absolute loss that can be found only in death - but because the music fails to bring them to the level that needs to be there to catch someone\\'s ear and ingrain them in their memory.Indeed, the brightest moment on the entire album was the opening notes of \"Who Knows\" with it\\'s melodic keyboard/guitar chords, and it seemed as if that was the one song that was going to go somewhere new and exciting, and dare I saw musically emotive. Sadly, with the chorus came yet another run of the mill upbeat messege but totally uoriginal anthemic songs.Still, it does stand out as a potential hit, as do the mid-tempo guitar driven \"Nobody Home\" and \"Fall To Pieces,\" the latter of which is lyrically a carefully disguised anthem about obession. Finally the other songs that will have the most likelihood of gaining airplay are \"Don\\'t Tell Me\" and the most melodic song on the album, the upbeat and overall best song on the album, \"My Happy Ending\".This is a good album, from a good artist, and she is still young in her career. Hopefully with development she will be able to sucessfully combine the memorable music from her first album with the innovative lyrics from her second. But for now, she is not quite there yet.',\n",
       " \"Another twelve superb songs by Canada's best new talent although not in the same masterpiece league as Let Go, Under My Skin is still a must have for anyone's collection.  I always wait a month or so before reviewing a newly acquired album as you tend to listen to and like most albums more when they first come out which would reflect in your review if you wrote it straight away.  I still listen to Under My Skin but to be honest I do listen to her first album Let Go a lot more. Still this a great collection and breath of fresh air when compared to most attractive young female singers who cannot write their own songs and rely more on image and tabloid marketing to sell their albums than raw talent. Who cares if Avril is really a punk or skater? I buy CDs for the music not the artist's image and this is another great album with no fillers.\",\n",
       " \"Avril Lavigne's second studio album, &quot;Under My Skin&quot; takes listeners back to some of the familiar sounds of &quot;Let Go&quot; but also digs further into the total Arvil experience.As a whole, &quot;Under My Skin&quot; is generally more phylosophical, and less poetic (alought poetic lyrics are still very much present), than her debut effort. It also features more varied and versatile intros, and a slightly more mature sound, without losing the basic essence of her own style.Probably the best tracks on the album include the debut single &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; which follows the typical Avril sound, and the songs &quot;My Happy Ending,&quot; &quot;Fall to Pieces,&quot; and &quot;Freak Out.&quot; All are catchy and have an appealing beat.Although there are really no bad songs on the album, probably the least profound is &quot;Nobody's Home,&quot; which features more intene lyrics and a typical rock sound.Most of the other songs on &quot;Under My Skin&quot; seems to alternate between the Avril sound we are used to and a harder, edgier, deeper sound.Overall, this album is very promising and should help to keep Avril in the spotlight for some time. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed &quot;Let Go&quot; and most lyrical rock fans.\",\n",
       " 'Her first effort solidifed her place as the new, great pop-rocker with its somewhat weak lyrics and its younger audience attraction. This effort, however, is a great improvement- more mature material and a truer edge worthier to be called rock. Every song is worthy of multiple listens- worthy to be released as a single. Is she a true rocker? Is she a pop princess disguised? Who cares... in the end, its all about the music- the better, more mature music of Avril Lavigne.',\n",
       " \"UNDER MY SKIN is the sophomore effort by &quot;bad girl&quot; Avril Lavigne.  While the music is still very much pop, the lyrics have more meaning to them and explore deeper into life.  Avril left the boys of The Matrix and combined with Evan Taubenfeid, Chantal Kreviazuk, Ben Moody (Evanscence), Raine Maida, and Butch Walker to create her new voice and it shows in the tracks.  While not as many radio friendly tunes as the debut, the album supports enough tracks to make a fine stay on the charts.  Some of my personal favorites are as follows:&quot;Together&quot;  the tale of a couple who no longer feel they are connecting to one another.&quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;  the first single.  The tale of a girl standing up for herself when a guy puts her down for not &quot;giving it up&quot; right away.&quot;My Happy Ending&quot;  the second single and the best track on the album.  This tells of a romance gone bad and should remain on the charts throughout the summer.&quot;Nobody's Home&quot; is the song with Ben Moody.  It is the tale of a woman trying to find her way, but cannot.&quot;Slipped Away&quot; is the song dedicated to her grandfather, who recently passed.  Very nice tribute to someone she obviously cared very deeply for.I highly recommend Avril's album, but if you are looking for a repeat of her first album, you will be disappointed.\",\n",
       " 'Avril Lavigne made a debut that was miraculous for such a new comer with her hit album Let Go which left many teens following the \"I\\'m-Rock-But-I\\'m-Not-Punk\" trend.  Finally after eight Grammy nominations, four Juno nominations and a sold Try To Make Me Shut Up tour she makes her return with her sophomore album Under My Skin which she promised would show a new side of her.This album did show a new side as she promised, one that was different from her \"Sk8er Boi\" days.  This go around her lyrics are more deep which might come as a surprise to her old fans.  If you were expecting her old music such as \"Complicated\" and \"Things I\\'ll Never Say\" you will almost be let down, because it\\'s not the same.  However, those who liked Avril\\'s music style but not her lyrical preference then this will be a good relief.She started off with her first single \"Don\\'t Tell Me\" which is a song dedicated to young women who don\\'t want to give up their values but their partner defy them.  To be honest, I think there were more single worthy songs, but hey, I\\'m not Avril.The cd however starts off with \"Take Me Away\", which is a great way to start off the album with it\\'s almost The Donna-like rock style and catchy chorus.  The closest thing you will get to Let Go category is \"He Wasn\\'t\" which consists of catchy pop verses and chorus\\'.  \"My Happy Ending\" is also a good song highlighted by it\\'s catchy chorus, which I believe is going to be Avril\\'s next single.  Next is \"Nobody\\'s Home\" which was co-made with ex-guitarist of Evanescence: Ben Moody, which tells a sad story of a woman that goes down a depressing road of loneliness.Over-all Avril\\'s new cd is a delight to anyone who is willing to take both Avril and change at the same time.',\n",
       " \"Under My Skin rocks the house!!!!!  I absolutely love it!!!!  It has been in my CD player since the day it was released.  Each song has lots of edge and has a darker tone.  Also, they are very catchy and I can't stop listening to them.  It shows a more mature side of Avril, lyric wise and vocal.  She is talented beyond her years and definitely proved herself as an artist with this album.  It's truly her best work to date and I will always love her music and have much respect for her.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys Let Go.  You will not be disappointed.  Avril is the best!!!!!!!  Rock on!  :)\",\n",
       " 'I liked the album, it\\'s different from \"Let go\". Great Lyrics, great sound.Take me away: Good, it\\'s depressing but it\\'s true! \"Is there inside all I do is hide...\" I think she talks about herself, it\\'s deep and meaningful. Great rock elements on the chorus. 10/10Together: It\\'s a great song. I feel so identified with it. The best part is: \"My thoughts are choking on you my dear\". I liked the guitar. 10/10Don\\'t tell me: It\\'s a popish song, but I liked. Good Message: Don\\'t give it to the boys who only wants your sex. hehe.He wasn\\'t: I liked! It reminds me a little about \"Sk8er Boi\", the music. It\\'s not great lyrically, but aceptable. It\\'s quite funny, is about the guy that you like doesn\\'t give you a call. \"He never make me feel Like I was special, cuz I was special, cuz I\\'m special...\" Bit weird! But I liked! 8/10How Does it feel: I liked the lyrics, but I don\\'t like much the song. But it\\'s good. 7/10My Happy Ending: I understand perfectly why Avril could write a song like this. I really like it, it\\'s a good song, quite sad but good. 9/10Nobody\\'s Home: Quite soft, but one of my favorites. Great chorus, great lyrics!!! Next single, good choice as a single.Forgotten: My favorite song of the album. Strong, sad, dark and angry. That\\'s what I like!!! 11/10. The piano it\\'s great, the voice of Avril with her \"ah, ah\" it\\'s amazing, cool!Who Knows: I don\\'t like it much. But I like the lyrics. 7/10Fall To pieces: Interesting, it shows an Avril who is in love with a guy. \"I just wanna cry in front of you\", I feel identified. whoa! I really liked!! Great Ballad. 10/10Freak Out: It\\'s a great song about standing up for yourself. Optimistic! I like the guitars and the bass! 9/10Slipped Away: Good song, but quite sad and slow. I liked it, but it is not my favortite. 8/10By the way...All the Avril haters can kiss my a**!!!!!',\n",
       " \"People have been declaring this the album in which Avril matures and becomes a woman. I have to say, personally, I disagree. Don't get me wrong, I actually really enjoy this album (probably a lot more than I should), I just don't think that Avril's music has &quot;grown up&quot; an immense amount between the release of 'Under My Skin' and the release of her first album ('Let Go'). Rather, I find that the way she acts off stage is the thing that's really altered. Lately, Avril has actually seemed a lot more outgoing, friendly, and all-around happier than she did before. To be perfectly honest, when her first album was released, I found that, during interviews, and other media exposure, Avril's indifference and I'm-too-cool-to-care-about-all-this attitude somewhat annoyed me. I think that by the time Avril releases her third album, it will be the one that really showcases her growth and maturity, but that's just my opinion.The album starts off on a good note with 'Take Me Away'. Although it's lyrics are very &quot;high school&quot;, the music is very strong. It was a good choice for the first track (as was 'Losing Grip' on Avril's debut). The second song, 'Together' is strong, but it's not one of the best tracks on the album. It basically refers to feeling better apart from someone rather than when they're together. The third track, and first single from the album is 'Don't Tell Me'. It was written by Avril when she first started her career (way back when she was 17), and it's among the best tracks on 'Under My Skin'. 'He Wasn't' is my least favourite song from the album. Both the music and the lyrics seem somewhat immature to me. Some reviewers have been refering to it as 'Skater Boi Part II' other than the fact that I find them both extremely annoying, I don't quite see the similarity. However, the album overcomes this major flaw when it progresses into 'How Does It Feel'. This is one of the strong songs on the album. It's quite slow and, although it's very simple, the lyrics are very heartening and sweet.The halfway point, and second single to drop from the album is 'My Happy Ending'. Musically, it's another one of the up-beat tracks. Lyrically, it's about discovering that the guy Avril thought would be a part of her happily ever after turned out to not be the person she thought he was. 'Nobody's Home' is a beautiful song about a girl who can't figure out where she belongs. It's heartwrenching and filled with emotion. It's definitely one of my favourite tracks on 'Under My Skin'. 'Forgotten' is another great song. It's among the fast songs on the album, and it's lyrics remind me somewhat of those found on 'My Happy Ending' and, from her debut album, 'Unwanted'. The ninth track, 'Who Knows' is among the many songs written by Avril Lavigne and Chantal Kreviazuk. It's simple and upbeat, and it's about not knowing what could happen, but to continue living life to the fullest. 'Fall To Pieces' is my favourite song off of 'Under My Skin'. It's both beautiful, overwhelmingly sweet, and sad. Simply said, it's about love. Consider the lyrics,&quot;If I had my wayI'd never get over youToday's the dayI pray that we make it throughMake it through the fallMake it through it all&quot;'Freak Out' is an up-beat track very much like 'My World', which could be considered Avril's &quot;theme song&quot; from 'Let Go'. The last song on the album is 'Slipped Away'. It's a song dedicated to Avril's deceased grandfather. It's a little bit fluffy, but, nonetheless, very cute and charming.I would definitely recommend this album to fans who liked Avril's first album. Chances are, you'll like this one as well. Although it has some minor setbacks ('He Wasn't and 'Who Knows' being the major ones), many of the songs are undoubtedly more mature and inspiring than any of those off of 'Let Go'. 'Don't Tell Me', 'How Does It Feel', 'Nobody's Home' , 'Forgotten', and 'Fall To Pieces' are definitely the standout tracks off of Avril Lavigne's 'Under My Skin'.THE FINAL VERDICT: 85%\",\n",
       " \"I go around saying I can't little avril and then I go and buy this album because I can't get the song &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; out of my head.

You'll regret it when you're all reached the age of 18 though but still, hey, time makes fools of us all!Okay sure, she has a good voice, but there's nothing new here people!\",\n",
       " 'Contrary to the typical pop-punk and \"feel good\" tunes that Avril produced on her first album, this sophomore effort heads in a different direction, though you can still tell that she\\'s trying to mix in the new with the old.Though collectively there\\'s no incredible change in this album with most tracks sounding like an extension of \\'Let Go\\', it wouldn\\'t be suprising if most were impressed by the ballad-side with tracks such as \"Nobody\\'s Home\" and \"How Does It Feel\".The failed anticipation of hearing edgier instrumentals (that would lead Avril into a more alternative sound) is the only thing that supports the 4/5 rating. Nonetheless the second time around isn\\'t all that bad.01. Take Me Away (3/5) - Not bad, though the vocals seem a bit overdone, I can only hear Avril push her voice so much to the point that the song almost becomes annoying. Worth a listen or two.02. Together (4.5/5) - This one grew on me, as mentioned in the previous song, the high-pitched vocals weren\\'t too appealing, Avril should try to tone this down on her next album, she\\'s has a beautiful voice, though the high notes don\\'t sound smooth. All in all, good song but not great.03. Don\\'t Tell Me (4.5/5) - Of course by now the first single is a little played out, it has the typical sound, typical background vocals, not too impressed though it was a good choice to release first.04. He Wasn\\'t (3/5) - And then comes the pure pop-punk track, it almost sounds like a Green Day song. Worth skipping, you won\\'t miss much.05. How Does It Feel (5/5) - Arguably the best track on the entire album. Beautiful, haunting, poetic, you name it. A great step in the right direction, this is what I like to hear from Avril. Most compatible to either \"I\\'m With You\" or \"Tomorrow\" from the first album. Single-worthy.06. My Happy Ending (4.5/5) - A little more upbeat here, I really enjoyed this track, again beautiful vocals throughout all 4 minutes.07. Nobody\\'s Home (5/5) - This is a song filled with a lot of sorrow, again it\\'s poetic, but at the same time, very \\'drowning\\', the second highlight of the album.08. Forgotten (4.5/5) - Very different sound here, the song picks up in each chorus and has a very slow, progressive build up. By far the most original track.09. Who Knows (5/5) - Michelle Branch-esque. That\\'s all I need to say, not bad.10. Fall To Pieces (5/5) - Same as above, though I enjoy the instrumental throughout the first minute or so of this one.11. Freak Out (4/5) - Beautiful vocals in the chorus, aside from the attempt to be a harder pop-rock song, it\\'s very tolerable to listen to.12. Slipped Away - (4/5) - Could the album have ended with a better song? Yes, but I suppose song order doesn\\'t really apply here. Great vocals.',\n",
       " \"Take Me Away: 5/5 The whole song is awesome. Probably my third favorite.Together: 5/5 I'm attracted to the chorus.Don't Tell Me: 3/5 I listened to it way too often so now I don't like it as much. :( I like the message of the song, though. (Don't have sex with guys who only wanted you for sex.)He Wasn't: 3/5 Not much melody. More like a bratty girl complaining about a guy.How Does It Feel: 3/5 I don't like the beginning too much, but it gets better.My Happy Ending: 5/5 This is my favorite song throughout the albums even before the MTV started showing it. (No, I'm really not an MTV addict.) I can relate with it very well right now. I kind of hate the way they changed the s word to &#34;stuff,&#34; cause it really changes the meaning, but I guess kids can't sing it if it stayed original.Nobody's Home: 4/5Forgotten: 4/5 I love the guitar.Who Knows: 4/5 Strangely, the chorus is the worst part of the song.Fall to Pieces: 5/5 This is my second favorite song in this album. A little bit out of character, though. (&#34;I just wanna cry in front of you.&#34; &#60;why would Avril cry in front of a guy??&#62;)Freak Out: 3/5 For some reason I just don't like this song that much.Slipping Away: 5/5 I can't relate to the song, but I love the chorus.Conclusion: This album is totally different from Avril's previous album. I miss her lighter and catchier songs, but these songs are great, too, in their own way. That being said, Avril has definitely lost her trademark.\",\n",
       " 'When we picked up \"Under My Skin\" it was one of several albums that went into the CD player in the car and when I did a milk run and was first listening to \"Forgotten\" I thought I was listening to the new Alanis Morissette album.  But after \"Let Go\" this second album by Avril Lavigne is certainly a step in a better, arguably more mature, direction.  On \"Let Go\" Lavigne worked with producer/songwriters Clif Magness and the Matrix, who polished up her melodic, edgy sound.  Her singles \"Complicated\" and \"Sk8er Boi\" both went top 10 and we figured we had Lavigne pegged as another female teenager singer-songwriter with pop sensibilities and shallow lyrics.But for \"Under My Skin\" there are two key changes.  The producer is now Don Gilmore (engineer on Pearl Jam\\'s \"Ten\" and producer of several Linkin Park albums) and fellow Canadian Chantal Kreviazuk (who I recognize from \"Time\" on the \"Uptown Girl\" soundtrack) has a hand in writing half of the dozen tracks and does piano, keyboards, and string arrangements as well.  Do Gilmore and Kreviazuk get the credit for making \"Under My Skin\" a better album or does Lavigne actually get most of the credit?  Damned if I call tell, but somebody did some serious upgrading of the lyrics.Lavigne is writing songs about the down side of teenage boys, which is an expansive subject matter to contemplate.  After all, teenage boys are the modern equivalent of the giant dinosaurs of the past that needed a second brain at the other end to help them along.  When dealing with them the fundamental rule is to remember that whenever the other brain is engaged, do not believe anything that is being said.  As she points out in \"Forgotten,\" it is not like they are listening to you:Have you forgottenEverything that I wantedDo you forget it nowYou never got ItDo you get it nowIf there is an obvious anthem on this album it would have to be \"Don\\'t Tell Me,\" where she finds these boys wanting because of what they want and have the gall to expect:Guess it wasn\\'t enough to take up some of my loveGuys are so hard to trustDid I not tell you that I\\'m not like that girl?The one who gives it all away[Chorus:]Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you, this time?Did you think that it was somethin I was gonna do and cry?Don\\'t try to tell me what to do,Dont try to tell me what to say,Your better off that wayThe consistent perspective in these songs is rather retrospective, as the charm and illusions on the teenage infatuation that passes for love is dispelled by the harsh realities of being a teenage girl.  It is not surprising then that \"My Happy Ending\" is about anything but:You were everything, everything that I wantedWe were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost itAnd all the memories, so close to me, just fade awayAll this time you were pretendingSo much for my happy endingThe theme is rather pessimistic from the start as we see in first track, \"Take Me Away,\" which establishes the idea that teenage love is pretty confusing:All the pain I thought I knewAll the thoughts lead back to youBack to what was never saidBack and forth inside my headI can\\'t handle this confusionI\\'m unable; come and take me awayBut since I keep thinking that this perspective smacks more of realism than pessimism, it seems to me that in the final analysis Lavigne is not only comforting young women but giving their male counterparts broad hints on what they are doing wrong.  Teenage boys can just listen to \"He Wasn\\'t\" and then do the opposite:Sit on the bed alone, staring at the phone.He wasn\\'t what I wanted, what I thought, no.He wouldn\\'t even open up the door.He never made me feel like I was special.He isn\\'t really what I\\'m looking for.This is when I start to bite my nails.And clean my room when all else fails.I think it\\'s time for me to bail.This point of view is getting stale.If teenage boys listen to the lyrics of \"Under My Skin\" then they should know how to do better.  But they better not try to fake it because Lavigne\\'s target audience is going to be singing along with these songs and the words are going to get through.  I have been listening to this album repeatedly for about two weeks as you can tell even I started paying attention to the lyrics when I was singing along.  I have two teenage daughters and I certainly made sure that they got hooked on these songs as well.',\n",
       " \"This sucks, how does she call herself a punk rocker she sounds just like all the other crappy pop on mtv. What happened to true punk like the Ramones or the Clash, that was real punk. Avril Lavigne also claims that she plays the guitar, so what she plays it like crap, you could pick the guitar up for one day and be as good as her. If you want to here some real music, some real rock music then check out bands like Silvertide and Rose Hill Drive, they are very talented bands. Don't listen to this MTV crap! F**K MTV!\",\n",
       " 'Avril isn\\'t what you\\'d call a talented singer, but she proves to us that she can write good songs that will last.\"Under my Skin\" is the second album of this young Canadian rock singer, if compared to \"Let Go\", \"Under My Skin\" is darker, and we can now tell that Lavigne has grown, from her skater punk rock lyrics to \"Nobody\\'s Home\", a song about a lost girl who kind of went the in the wrong direction... I was surprised that Lavigne can write songs like this. \"Happy Ending\" is the best out of this album, about a guy getting influenced by his friends who doesn\\'t like this singer. Yes, most of the lyrics are shallow, and Lavigne doesn\\'t usually show a lot of feelings when she is recording.From what I\\'ve heard, \"Don\\'t Tell Me\" was written even before her first single from \"Let Go\", \"Complicated\". \"Freak Out\", another one of my favorites about believing in yourself and your own decisions (that\\'s what Avril REALLY likes to write about, I\\'m actually tired of it already)is also written before.I used to think although I enjoy Avril Lavigne\\'s songs, her success had been pure luck. Now I look forward to her next album, hoping it comes soon with better music!',\n",
       " 'Avril\\'s first CD wasn\\'t my favorite. Just sounded like she was trying to be a bit too punk and it sounded like her record execs gave her no creative freedom. In other words, it was crap. The number 1 hits like Sk8ter Boi and Complicated got old...REAL fast. It was thrown back into my pile of CDs, barely scratched and forgotten in my large collection of various kinds of music.With the release of \"Don\\'t Tell Me\" and \"My Happy Ending\", I knew those things had been fixed. Her personality came out in her songs, more \"girlpower\" than ever, and it showed in her lyrics, however slightly immature they were. Sure, the lyrics could have been deeper, and the guitars could have been more \"kick ass\" but the songs were none the less Lavigne, and catchy. The CD broke the mold of her previous \"punk rocker\" image, and went into more of a matured pop/rock artist-admired by thousands of girls over the world.Half of the people that review her on here probably haven\\'t even listened to the album. Lower ratings are given by angered teens  who call her a \"poser\" and say that she changed her image and such because she\\'s fake. Hello? Am I missing something here? Most teenagers go through a phase in trying to discover themselves, Lavigne is entitled to go through that phase. And sure, she did dress \"punk\" and outside of concerts and photo shoots of course she dresses normally...It\\'s a PERFORMANCE. She does it to please her fans. Nobody wants to see her scream about how life sucks in a pink Abercrombie T shirt and light blue capri pants. Just because she does that doesn\\'t mean she\\'s fake, and an argument like that isn\\'t justified. When you consider this CD screw the image, the music is what\\'s important.Most of the songs on this CD are quite different from each other (when considering the musical elements), which differs from the last album, Let Go, and keeps the listener from getting bored quickly. She ends the CD with a Ballad about losing her Grandfather, and also sings a mid-CD ballad about individuality (\"How does it feel/ You\\'re different than me\"). Nobody\\'s Home is a personal favorite, and overall the CD is very moody. GREAT for bad days or really long trips in the car in which bored children or road rage is involved. ;) I was surprised, my Mother even liked it. Enough to accompany me to the concert in August along with my cousin. Diss the concerts all you want, but at least she sings (Unlike a certain Simpson sister we know) and at least she isn\\'t off key the whole time (Like a certain lead singer of Evanescence or the infamous Hoobastank).Overall, Lavigne\\'s just out there telling the world how she feels by using music, her choice creative outlet. And she does it quite effectively, with songs many can relate too. I would recommend this CD to anyone-even Lavigne haters (and out of the 4 I know and have told about the CD, 3 have bought it and thorougly enjoyed it, and the 4th burned it but still liked it.)This CD is one of the 5 out of my (around 150) collection, that I know I can pop in and not have to worry about since the whole thing is good. It is DEFINATELY worth the 13 bucks.Side Note* I don\\'t know if Amazon has an edition (I would check into it) without the curse words but if you do have small children (like my next door neighbor). She doesn\\'t curse all over the place, but there are 2 words that might bother a parent.',\n",
       " \"I don't know if I'd  reccomend this for fans of 'Let Go' or not, but I will say this is a very good album.1. Take Me Away- A great way to start the album, the chorus is really cool, but the song is too short. 9/10 Unwanted Part II2. Together- This sort of takes a cue from &quot;Take Me Away&quot; becuase one of the verses goes like this. She jsut normally sings &quot;When I'm alone, I feel so much better but when I'm around you, I don't feeeel........ (then she screams out the chorus &quot;TOGETHER DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT AT ALL TOGETHER WE BUILT A WALL................&quot; 10/10 Losing Grip II3. Don't Tell Me- The first single, I don't really like this song. I like the message but now I'm jsut sick of this song. 7/10 Complicated Part II4. He Wasn't- This has a poppy feel but it's pretty good anyway. 9/10 Sk8er Boi Part II5. How Does It Feel- I love this song, the guitar is good, and the lyrics are interesting. 10/10 Tomorrow Part II6. My Happy Ending- I don't think this is a favorite but it's good. 8/10 Too Much To Ask Part II7. Nobody's Home- A favorite. It's a really sad song and has a lot of emotion in it. 10/10 I'm With You Part II8. Forgotten- This soing is really cool. It rocks out without getting too loud, and althoguh I like loud rock songs, you don't come across a song like this that often. 10/10 It doesn;'t sound Let Go-ish9. Who Knows?- I hate this song! ICK ICK ICK! Doesn't really fit in.6/10 Mobile Part II10. Fall To Pieces- A nice mid tempo ballad, I like. 10/10 Things I'll Never Say Part II11. Freak Out-A good song, about not listening to anyone. Awesome great, stuperb song! 10/10 Nobody's Fool Part II12. Slipped Away- I really can't describe it. It made me cry so bad. 10/10 Naked Part II\",\n",

This is total pop music. Some may call it pop/rock but the more pop than rock. It's just sad. If you want some punk rock made by women you should try Babes In Toyland, Bikini Kill, L7, early Hole, Bratmobile, Huggy Bear, etc. These bands were around when Avril was still in elementary school!

I originally bought this album as a joke, because her last one, I thought, was so bad it was funny. But I was blown away on how good this is. It is much more hard-core punk than the more teeny-bopper geared Let Go. This is just one of my favorite albums. It is just SO good. Her singing voice has matured quite a bit, too. Get this for your ear's sake.\",\n",

Still a good album except for \"He Wasn\\'t\" Im a guy so i tend to skip over that one coz im not gay. Anyways look out for more reviews soon from me. Peace out everyone!',\n",
       " 'This album rocks! Avril Lavigne is a really great singer! She does cuss a little bit in 2 of her songs but it\\'s still good! This album is MUCH BETTER than her previous album! In her other CD, she acts like a punk and tries to be so cool, but in this one she finally uses her common sense in my oppinion, and makes much better pop music instead of her other punk and rap!1. Take me away - 10/10 An awesome beginning to the album! I like the beginning of the song a lot, too. This also has a great chorus!2. Together - 10/10 Nice! I really like the tune and vocals in this, it makes it sound so musical. I think this song should be a single, I\\'m a little surprised it isn\\'t.3. Don\\'t tell me - 10/10 Cool! This has a nice chorus, and the lyrics are pretty interesting, I like how she wrote it all out and everything, and the video of this song is pretty good, too.4. He wasn\\'t - 7/10 Um, why does this song have a music video? This is the only song on this CD that I really don\\'t like too much. It just sounds so weird, and I don\\'t get why it was made a single.5. How does it feel - 9/10 When I first listened to this one, I didn\\'t really like it cuz I\\'m not a big fan of slow songs like this one, but I listened to it more and it\\'s actually not bad! I especially like the ending when she sings \"how does it feel, you\\'re different from me\" in a high-pitched voice, it makes it sound very pretty.6. My happy ending - 10/10 AWESOME! Best song on the CD! I first heard this one on the radio, because it\\'s one of her most popular hits, and I really liked it! And check out the video, it\\'s great too!7. Nobody\\'s home - 10/10 This too, is one her most popular hits, and it\\'s really cool! The video was pretty interesting. This is a sad song, but I like sad songs a lot surprisingly, and this is the type I like.8. Forgotten - 9/10 This one is also pretty good, I like the tune it\\'s very creative and full of meaning, and I also like the way she made herself sound in this.9. Who knows - 10/10 Ah, finally a happy song! I may like sad songs, but I love happy songs! In this song she\\'s basically telling a story of how someone looks very familier to her, and how she\\'d like to get to know him some, and I like that. It\\'s definitely easy to understand.10. Fall to pieces - 10/10 Wow! This one is pretty good too! I\\'m surprised she doesn\\'t have a video of this song, cuz I think I\\'ve heard it before on the radio, but I\\'m not sure, it might\\'ve been something else. I like the lyrics too, they make the song sound very pretty.11. Freak out - 10/10 This one\\'s great too, and once again, the tune and instruments sound very familiar, like I\\'ve heard it once before or something, but not as much as the previous one, and the lyrics are cool.12. Slipped away - 10/10 This song is very sweet and very sad at the same time. She wrote this song in memory of her grandfather, because he died, and tells how much she misses him in this song, and I like it a lot, it\\'s a great ending to this song.Well, there it is! I told you I liked this album better than her previous one. And thanks for reading this review, I hope it was helpful(forgive me if it wasn\\'t)!

       " 'THIS IS THE MOSE PUNK ALBUM OF ALL TIME!!!! Avril is a goddess on the guitar and writes music better than ANYONE else. She is also da best s8kt0r in history. Her lyrics are genius. All the 5 star reviewers here are genius and cultered, just like myself. Like many people, I love talented musicians. And where do you find those? TRL of course!! You should get this if you want good music. If you want good music then also get:-Nirvana (music became good after them and Kurt is second to only avril on guitar)- Good Charlotte, Blink 182, Simple plan (brutal punk rock)- g-unit (there is no greater team of musicians with more overall talent)- Vanilla Ice (created Rap and hip-hop. Ice Ice baby!)- Kenny G (he\\'s sold more albums than any other instrumental \"artist\", so therefore he is better)- Ashlee Simpson- Limp Bizkit (created metal)-Linkin Park-Metallica (St Anger may be the best metal album ever that doesn\\'t feature Fred Durst)This is what you should not get:-Miles Davis (this guy was a poser. Get Kenny G instead)-baroque classical posers like Mozart, Bach, Paganini, Beethoven, Chopin etc-self proclaimed \"rock\" bands ie Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, The Who, Queen etc-posers who think they can play the guitar (Segovia, Rhodes, Satriani, Friedman, Holdsworth, Reinhardt, Van Halen etc)- socalled \"metal bands\" like old Metallica, Megadeth, Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden-any of that \"progressive\" crap like Dream Theater',\n",
       " 'I don\\'t care what some of the reviews out there say. When you look at today\\'s music, a lot of it is pop. Some is pop-rock, but mainly pop. However, this album is Rock with a little bit of pop in it. This album has drive in the songs and Avril shows us that she can sing without the use of auto-tune and other similar effects. Yes, this was made in 2004, almost a decade ago, but it was still around that time that artists began using stuff like that. But anyway: Avril\\'s music here is very strong, has meaning, and is legit. Legit meaning that it\\'s not all electronic (in fact, this album is all real instruments; there\\'s no electronic influence in it that I can hear. I listen to lots of rock and metal and I can play some of this album\\'s heavier songs with those rock/metal songs and it\\'s not out of place.The music:1. \"Take Me Away\"- This song starts off the album right. It starts off with a simple little guitar part and then she comes in and starts singing. It just progressively gets heavier and builds into the chorus. I like her voice. It sounds very powerful and inspired and the heaviness doesn\\'t sound forced at all either. It also has a certain degree of darkness to it that makes it very interesting to listen to. The song is very strong and I love listening to it very much.2. \"Together\"- This one is an interesting and unique song. I like the piano part in it and while she\\'s singing about relationships and stuff that lots of pop singer sing about, this doesn\\'t sound cliche and \"written for the sake of writing it\". This sounds good! While it\\'s a subject we hear songs about daily, it\\'s done in a way that probably can\\'t be duplicated. Once again, her voice is strong here and she\\'s created another song I\\'ve listened to numerous times.3. \"Don\\'t Tell Me\"- This one follows in the footsteps of the previous song. This one is more of a power ballad than the previous one, but it again follows the same type of typical subject matter delivered in a unique way that only she can pull off. That\\'s something I truly love about listening to her music: It\\'s gonna be different than what other people are doing. Very nice song.4. \"He Wasn\\'t\"- I\\'m actually not too big a fan of this song. It\\'s not bad, but I don\\'t really like it. It\\'s catchy, yes. But this one has a punk type vibe to it. I\\'m not calling it a punk song, but I\\'m not gonna say that there\\'s no hints of it in here either. I\\'m just not a fan of that style is all. If I was, I\\'d probably like this song more. And again, yes, the lyrics deal with typical pop song-type subjects, but it\\'s delivered in a unique way.5. \"How Does it Feel\"- This one is a soft song. It\\'s a very relaxing song. This song is one of the stronger points of the album even if it is softer. The lyrics may seem a little cliche at first, but after a few listens, they become a bit more meaningful. Great song!6. \"My Happy Ending\"- This one is more pop-rock. This one is a good song, but this one is one of the songs on here where the pop influence comes across as stronger than the rock influence. Even so, though, it\\'s still a pretty good tune. Her vocal performance still comes off great and the music behind her is still better than your average pop artists nowadays. And the drums sound surprisingly cool! I actually like the beat that the drummer is playing on here (A rarity in today\\'s music, let alone pop music in general. As a drummer, this is a very rare thing to come across). Good song!7. \"Nobody\\'s Home\"- This one is one of my favorite songs on the album. I like the softer vibe of the song, but yet, the song has a darker sound to it and I find this unique. I can\\'t really describe this song very well because it\\'s just something so interesting! It\\'s beautiful! Avril is definitely a talented artist. The vocal performance on here is phenomenal! The emotion is just so there! I love this song!8. \"Forgotten\"- This one follows the previous track in the darker sound. This one is heavier and just as intense as the opener and the previous song. I feel the anger/sadness in her voice when I hear the previous song and this one. And the music while it is simple pop chord progressions, has a complexity to it that adds a level of intensity to it. Good song.9. \"Who Knows\"- I actually am not too big of a fan of this song. This song is pretty upbeat and I usually like upbeat songs...but this one interrupts the anger and intensity of the previous two songs and this one actually has weaker lyrics in my honest opinion. I mean, if this song came on either a different album or was in a different place, I think I would like it a lot better, but nope. I just feel that it lacks the intensity of the preceding songs and it just fails to impress me for that reason.10. \"Fall to Pieces\"- The opening to this one sounds sad again and it\\'s a softer rock song in the verses. This one is just a simple little rock-love song. This one is still good and has a certain level of originality to it, but isn\\'t the most unique way lyrics like this could\\'ve been delivered. I like the song though. It\\'s got the emotional intensity of the better songs here, but the pop influence is a little stronger in this one too. But this one definitely puts the album back in the right direction with the emotional intensity. Good song.11. \"Freak Out\"- This is a nice pop-rock song. The emotional intensity still flows through this song very well, yet it is more on the positive side too. This one strikes a good balance between the two vibes. I do like this one. Her voice is still strong, the music is still going great on this album, and the chorus is pretty catchy on this one.12. \"Slipped Away\"- This song starts off sounding sad and dark, but the chorus sounds a little more upbeat. This one is a nice closer to a great album. It\\'s just a nice little tune dealing with, again, stuff that\\'s usually cliche and overdone/not done well. This one is a pretty good song, and I like it. Avril really knew what she was doing when she made this album.Note: As a musician this album doesn\\'t off much technical things, however: The musicianship on this album is the BEST I\\'ve heard on a solo artist\\'s album at this point in time. The drums have beats that aren\\'t too complicated for the pop vibe in the songs, but they also have the drive in them to make me want to air drum along to some of the songs. The guitars have some cool stuff, but it\\'s mainly chords. She\\'s got a good amount of talent and she has writing credit on all the tracks. Yes, she collaborates with people, however, on most of the songs, she collaborated with only one other person and most times that other person is a musician and not a producer.Verdict: If you want pop music with some edge to it, this may or may not be your album depending on how much edge you want. If you want metal, this isn\\'t what you\\'ll get. If you want some good rock music, this is definitely your album. If you don\\'t care what kind of music it is as long as it contains emotion and feelings, then GET IT! This was my first album from her and certainly not my last.',\n",
       " 'In 1995 an album titled Jagged Little Pill under Madonna\\'s then-new fledgling label, Maverick Records, managed to make pop history. A collection of raw rock ditties put together by a little-know artist by the name of Alanis Morrisette broke records and launched a platform for every female artist. Not coincidentally the Lilith Fair era was on the rise back then, because music audiences started paying attention to female singer songwriters from a folk / rock category, which was predominantly testosterone-filled arena.Almost a decade later, this phenomenon has faded, not because of lack of material or emerging artists, but because of an underlying sexist factor. It\\'s not easy to have a strong woman signed to a label. Sinead O\\'Conner, anyone?Artists such as Joan Osborne and Alana Davis have been dropped from their label. Natalie Merchant and Tracy Chapman have both been mistreated by their companies. Both Fiona Apple and Sarah McLachlan took an immensely long hiatus. And the rise of Rap and Hip Hop left everybody wondering what the next big things is.Of course, in true music biz fashion, the moguls created more package-ready and compact pretty versions of what was earthy and not so manufactured artists.This spans everyone from the awfully bland Michelle Branch to the more recent tragedy FeFe Dobson. However, the most successfully one of that bunch has to be faux-punk Avril Lavigne - The bigwig\\'s way of cashing into teenage rebellion by avoiding the pretty counter-Britney.Let Go, her first album, annoyed everyone with the drag-along \"Complicated\" only partially rising with \"Sk8er Boi\" and then \"Losing Grip.\" Offering boring balladry in \"I\\'m With You\" along the way. With those songs she tapped into the heart of every girl and boy who are furious for not wanting to do their homework, thus collecting money and some ill-conceived recognition from critics.Under My Skin is the second round for this wide-eyed little Barbie punk. The album\\'s glossy booklet demonstrates her undying effort at making herself look tough. Avril already scored a hit the mundane \"Don\\'t Tell Me\" and now gaining swift success with the slightly brighter \"My Happy Ending.\" Other than the video magic, Avril sifts through this hapless release with a great mush of rock songs that are destined to temporarily spark a kid\\'s interest and then disappear as a funny period of pop culture, kind of like the powers rangers. There is no difference between, say, \"Fall To Pieces,\" \"Take Me Away\" and the closing track \"Slipped Away.\"\"Nobody\\'s Home\" and \"Forgotten\" are apt for Avril fans - both songs of bubblegum anguish.This is not to say that Lavigne won\\'t be a favorite with MTV still and have a growing catalogue of hits, but she has yet to prove that she is an individual artist with a profound talent other than the physical and musical tweaking of industry masterminds.If Sid Vicious knew that punk would come to this, he wouldn\\'t have bothered.',\n",

Amber\\'s first Single out, the Alt Rock infused \"You Move Me\" hit #1 at XM Radio.  And \"Voodoo\" is currently being mixed for a Commercial release in early 2005.  Fans of Avril should check out the Rock tracks \"Just Like That\" and \"Sacrificial Lamb\", likely the 3rd and 4th Singles.

Ive listened to this cd and for a pop alternative cd it comes through nicely . It has your reapeat loops but dont be so quick to bash this cd . It has some powerful lyrics that are short yet sweet . I dont think people are looking/listening closer than they should . aside from the trendy bashing of this artist ive noticed this thing avril does in her songs . its this motivation she brings out that i think if anything is going to be mainstream it should atleast be positive .which this is. If youre only listening to the singles and think you know this artist .. well youre wrong . also , i can tell by the comments of bashers cause all they seem to be commenting is on the singles and what does this mean kiddies ... they infact watch mtv or listen to the radio more than the average avril fan who buys the cd's and has been to the concerts . so they lie and what do we call liars ... posers .\",\n",
       " 'In my review for \"Let Go\" I said that she would either be a big hit for years or fall off the face of the Earth in a heartbeat. Well, here it is - the sophomore effort - and results are mixed. This album is actually a step back for Avril lyrically (as if that were possible with lyrics like, \"He was a Skater boy, `I said see you later boy\\'\") it is just too simple - honest but childish - (ex: \"...you gave me that kiss, It was something like this, It made me go oh-oh\"; I can almost hear Hilary Duff laughing at her.) However, the music is more down to earth, but that is actually a bad because the loud strings might hide her mediocre singing (which doesn\\'t come close to her last album). This album just doesn\\'t hit the right cord at all; it\\'s too much effort for such minimal result.There are a few saving graces, however. Cute \"punk-girl\" songs like \"Don\\'t Tell Me\" and \"My Happy Ending\" are reminiscent of older Avril, and good attempts at feeling, such as, \"How Does It Feel\" and \"Nobody\\'s Home\" do hover near the \"good song mark.\"As a whole the album is a wreck. A friend asked me if I thought I was being a little harsh on Avril, and I replied, \"Well she was a little harsh on my ears.\" BOTTOM LINE --- Good, entertaining, and a solid 4, but far from a Happy Ending!',\n",
       " 'After hearing my friends talking about Avril, I decided to check her out. I had this nasty feeling deep inside what kind of music I would hear, and while its not horrible, its 100% typical, standard Teen Rock. The Lyrics portrait her as downright simple and unable to express some more mature writing, and most of the songs are like a face in the crowd, something anyone else could do. However, Its not bad, so no personal thing against Avril, its just that she really cant make it anything unique. Its Accessible and wannabe Rock, but it works for its purpose and for the ones who are drawn towards her simple and easy attitude.When it comes to hooks, most of the songs are more bothersome than really catchy. There is one real gem here, and thats &quot;Don`t Tell Me&quot;, which even grabbed me, a rather cynical listener towards the new generation of Music. The Lyrics are simple enough, but it builds up nicely, and the chorus is great and oh so adorable, and it just force you to listen to it again and again.There is something that just doesnt work with the most of her music apart from Dont Tell Me. &quot;Take Me Away&quot; is just irritating, and where the hooks should have been, there is just a finger on the skip button. &quot;Together&quot; is a pain. The Vocals are more of a headache than catchy, whatever she might think. &quot;He Wasnt&quot; is just uninspired. &quot;How does it Feel&quot; doesnt work, and never gets on the road as many other rock ballads succeeds with. &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; starts like millions of other teen rockers, and gets a thumb down from the beginning of. &quot;Nobody`s home&quot; is yet another clone, and you start to wonder why she cant write something original. The Riffs are irritating again. &quot;Forgotten&quot; Starts fresh, but it is just a false premonition, and the song becomes really irritating, much because her simple text becomes a pain to listen to. &quot;Who Knows&quot; does not work, if you are gonna use raw guitar riffs to hook the listener, you gotta do it right. Avril doesnt have a clue about this, she just cant get the feeling right. &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; sounds pretty much like any of the other songs, thats right. It just sound boring, and identical to all of her songs. Forgettable. &quot;Freak Out&quot; is another attempt for a rough sound, but it comes out as simple and more of a lame attempt to sound tougher than what she can do and be. Finally, the last song; &quot;Slipped Away&quot;, a ballad starting with a piano, but it just doesnt work. She almost got it, but something is missing.No, No, No Avril. You are not tough, and its time to wake up and smell the coffee. Its time to pay respect to the old generation and learn, instead of trying to clone the new teenbased Rock Generation. God Knows we`ve had enough of it. There IS potential in her, but first of all she gotta learn to write texts, and she gotta decide what she want to do. If she wanna be a rocker, she gotta get rid of her current sound and go for something rougher, something with a more pure sound, where bass and drums are left UNTOUCHED. Editing and mixing drums and bass in an attempt to get a cool sound is in my opinion a big turnoff with music. Anything you start to mix and edit becomes false, and doesnt sound good at all(Take the hint, let the basics of sound be left alone). Raw Power is Real Power, and only on &quot;Dont Tell Me&quot; she gets a taste of it with the good Chorus.I do not really recommend this album, but again, its not bad, its just so identical to dozens of other teenagerockers out there trying to make a point, and most of her songs are just uninteresting, bland and boring. Sorry Avril, you just arent cool, no matter how much you think so.',\n",
       " 'this CD is good...i definatly like her 1st CD better...it was more more lyricly inclined.

The opening tracks \"Take Me Away\" and \"Together\" are great ones...they are rocking...very powerful ones...\"Don\\'t Tell Me\" and \"How Does It Feels\" are great peaceful tracks. \"He Wasn\\'t\" isn\\'t my favourite track but it is fast and hard. \"My Happy Ending\" is maybe the best track in this album. Its video is pretty and good. It is a real rock track but not too hard that it was a good released to be as a single. \"Nobody\\'s Home\" and \"Forgotten\" are great tracks. That line from \"How Does It Feels\" to \"Forgotten\" is immaculate. The rest of the album is quite basic hard rock and closes with a peaceful ballad \"Slipped Away\". But still...quite a good album.Stars: Forgotten, Together, My Happy Ending',\n",
       " \"Lets face it people. 'Let Go' was pop, tinged with some faux-punk, and it made Avril look like the biggest poser/loser/hypocrite in the world. However, 'Under My Skin' is a pure, all-out rocker. The music, lyrics and voice have improved tenfold. 'Under My Skin' is about the realest, most intimate album out there right now, aimed at teens.The album starts off with &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, which has one of the catchiest riffs on the whole CD. After that, we're on &quot;Together&quot;, which can get stuck in your head for what seems like an eternity. After that, we're on &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; probably the only song out there, right now, that teaches young girls to say no whenever guys only want a piece or whatever. &quot;He Wasn't&quot; reminds me a lot of 'Sk8er Boi' however, it's a pretty catchy song. &quot;How Does It Feel&quot; is an incredible track, the words, music and Avrils voice sound sooo real and so amazing. &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; is the next release from &quot;Under My Skin&quot; and is one of the catchist songs on the CD. Next, we have &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; which has hard hitting words, about a girls longing to return to her youth. &quot;Forgotten&quot; is an alright song, not bad but not amazing either. &quot;Who Knows&quot; is really the only positive song the CD, catchy, nice message. After, we have &quot;Fall To Pieces&quot; which is such a pretty song, I really like it. &quot;Freak Out&quot; has one of the best music on the whole CD, however, I didn't really like the lyrics. And finally the last song &quot;Slipped Away&quot; is worthy of a tear. It's such a sad, passionate, emotional song. An amazing way to close the CD.Avril's voice and writing skills have greatly improved on this new CD. &quot;Under My Skin&quot; finally shows us what Avril was being made out to be when she first arrived on the scene. A rock chick who stands apart from the rest of the crowd in terms of image, attitude, music and voice. With this CD release, Avril is finally getting closer to making her own unique sound and style instead of looking like a puppet that record execs made to fill the void for people who aren't into Britney.\",\n",
       " \"After becoming the powerful iconic new voice in rock and roll with her blockbusterdebut album Let Go in 2002 and concert DVD My World in 2003, Avril Lavigne wouldbecome the new rock sensation that also helped inspire a steady generation of a fewgirls to choose a path of rock.  With her band and guitar in hand, Avril had toured theworld to packed audiences while she built a prolific recording career, which can evendescribe the blockbuster success of Under My Skin, which is highly showcased by afew classic hits including the Top Ten hit Take Me Away, and other classic hits inclu-ding Don't Tell Me, Nobody's Home, My Happy Ending, Who Cares? and Tomorrow.So, what make this bonafide second masterpiece just as great is that it includes fourlive special tracks that make it the best edition, as it give us a full hour of challengingmusic from start to finish.  What is even ironic about Under Her Skin even brings hercloser to the mature aspirations of the signer-songwriter and solid rock star destinedfor even greater progress for numerous decades to come where she showcases thedrama, optimism, creative genius, bold persuasions, world class excellence and hersolid showstopping momentum that made Lavigne such a mighty force from day oneand what lies ahead.  As a bonafide Number One album in North America and someEuropean and Latin American countries, this supercharged blockbuster CD had woncritical acclaim from many music publications like Entertainment Weekly and RollingStone as a result.  She have even been praised by some as the best thing that everhappen to since Elvis Presley (and I was one of those who strongly agree).\",\n",

Geeeez........................\",\n",
       " 'Avril Lavigne has proven skeptics wrong with both the success and credibility of sophomore effort, \"Under My Skin.\"  The album is stronger in all respects to her debut, \"Let Go\" and offers depth into the artist\\'s capabilities.I\\'ve always had a soft spot for Lavigne, ever since the \"Complicated\" craze back in 2002.  While some deem her lyrics simplistic and her voice bland, I find that that is a large appeal to Lavigne\\'s music.  While she\\'s not singing about grinding and dancing, Lavigne is singing about real issues in her life but in a clear manner.  She\\'s not a very introspective and innovative artist, but knows how to write a perfect pop song that actually has a message.Lead off single \"Don\\'t Tell Me\" bravely confronts the issues of virgnity and sex in a time where that seems to be all of what other young female singers are promoting.  Releasing this song as the first single proves Lavigne\\'s fearless efforts to prove that she is not just a product of Arista Records\\' pop parade, but a credible artist here to stay.If that didn\\'t prove it, \"My Happy Ending\" certainly does.  Clearly the album\\'s strongest cut, \"My Happy Ending\" is a perfect pop song in all respects.  Its guitar riff, hook, and lyrics show off Lavigne\\'s growth from songs like \"Sk8er Boi\" to a mature young woman experiencing life, relationships, and the losses that one experiences.  She isn\\'t going to whine on about how deeply she\\'s been affected for a whole album\\'s length, but is able to condense it into a truly great song.Other highlights on this album include \"How Does It Feel\", \"Take Me Away\" and \"Fall To Pieces.\"  There are a few flaws: \"He Wasn\\'t\" doesn\\'t fit here and is a little too immature and \"Slipped Away\" could have been better produced.  But given time and more experience, Lavigne will not only be able to craft more perfect pop songs, but the perfect pop album.',\n",
       " 'This is Avril\\'s sophmore effort, and im glad it finally came out. I was a very tiny bit dissapointed. Its still really good, almost great, but Let Go is 5 1/2 times better. Avril, you can do better. OK, lets get things started. \"Dont Tell Me\" is the first single which im sure almost everyones heard. It didnt get enough radio play, but it got enough to make it to the top 15, and even the top 25 on Billboard. \"My Happy Ending\" is the 2nd single, which is surely one of the best songs on the album. Its another relationship song. Its currently blowing up on Pop radio. I hope it does alot better than \"Dont Tell Me\". \"He Wasnt\" is the best song on the album. Its a really fun pop-punk track, and it does sound pretty punky. She raps/talks again for a little bit on the bridge, and just 2 short verses. It couldve been a little longer, but I still love it the way it is. \"How Does It Feel\" is a really nice ballad that will make you feel different from your boyfriend/girlfriend, as she says on the chorus: \"How does it feel to be/different from me/are we the same how does it feel\". Isnt it obvious? \"Nobody\\'s Home\" Is a great light and hard track that will be the next single. Its one of my favorites. \"Fall To Pieces\" has to be the worst song on the album, and it sounds like it shouldnt have been in place. Same as \"Freak Out\", although it does have its moments. \"Slipped Away\" is the last song on the album that is dedicated to her dead grandfather. I thought it said Grandma, but I read wrong. Dont get me wrong, im a great reader at things. \"Forgotten\" is the darkest song on the album, with a kind of eerie begenning, like a few reviewers said. OK, now time for the track listing and ratings!1. Take Me Away 5/5 No, its not a cover of FeFe Dobson\\'s song.2. Together 3.5/53. Don\\'t Tell Me 4.5/54. He Wasn\\'t 5/55. How Does It Feel 5/56.

Take Me Away5. How Does It FeelVery good album overall, but Let Go is better. Not half-bad, but my girl Avril can do better. Hope her 3rd album is better than this! Dont get me wrong, I really like this new style and routine of hers, its just that some of the songs lyrics are weird. She is still a great singer, and I admire her for that. Im glad shes getting more sucessful!!Buy it?: Yes, for any true Avril fan or who likes Hot AC or pop-punk!',\n",
       " 'If there\\'s one thing Avril Lavigne should know better, it\\'s timing. Releasing \"Under My Skin\" the same time as Jessica Simpson\\'s \"In this skin\" made it seem like she was not only ripping off Simpson, but also trying to use the album titles to boost sales of her album. Never-the-less, \"Under My Skin\" is different from Simpson\\'s album, in fact, it\\'s the polar opposite. Avril strays away from the light hearted nature of her debut album \"Let Go\" and instead works on a darker sound with more raw vocals. She also ditches the Matrix and Max Martin so she can focus more on pleasing herself, not necessarily her fans, with a collection of songs that best describes what she\\'s learning through the process of growing up. Now personally, I don\\'t we\\'re truly getting under her skin, or rather knowing more about her persona, but we are getting the chance to understand someone, whether it be a homeless person, a couple on the rocks, or a girl who simply wants her crush to know that she loves him. The most personal track off the album is \"Slipped Away\" which Avril notes is dedicated to her deceased grandfather. Bottom line, happy moments are rare on \"Under my skin\", but then again, with the amazing production and songwriting here, who needs them? This album makes dark and depressing soup for the soul. Her best moment comes from the track \"How does it feel?\", which Avril delivers powerfully and with great emotion, as she does with every other song on this album as well.',\n",
       " 'This is Avril Lavigne\\'s second album.  The cover photo is a little misleading---this is actually a fairly loud, fast-paced rock album, somewhat harder-rocking than her first album (\"Let Go\"), and there is indeed a touch of punk rock here.Musically speaking, I think that this actually sounds slightly superior to her first album, because I think it not only has better instrumentalization, but also because Lavigne sounds distinctly more mature and does more creative, higher-quality vocals throughout the album.Nearly all of the tracks are good songs and the singles (\"Don\\'t Tell Me,\" \"My Happy Ending,\" and \"Nobody\\'s Home\") all did well.  Nevertheless, I\\'d have to rate this album just below \"Let Go.\"  This is because even though this album has the more sophisticated music, I just don\\'t see any truly \"stand-out\" or memorable songs on it.Overall, this is a good album.  It will appeal particularly well for Avril fans and female rock fans, especially those who are still hurting due to a break-up; but if I had to choose between \"Under my Skin\" and \"Let Go,\" I\\'d have to choose \"Let Go.\"',\n",
       " \"To say that Avril Lavigne's musical abilities have grown leaps and bounds would be a bit of a stretch.  I see several parallels between this album and her debut 'Let Go'...and believe it or not, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  So many people love to assume she's got nothing to say, and that's fine - everyone likes different things.  I happen to think Avril's outspoken ways make for interesting music.  Can you say that she's not unique?  Disregard the fact that all your peers think she's a &quot;poser punk&quot;, and listen to the stuff yourself and make up your own mind.  Although this isn't a masterpiece, it's far from horrible.  You won't find this CD constantly in my CD player, but it's really not as bad as most people make it out to be (ironically enough, most of these people haven't even listened to the album).  My favorite tracks include &quot;Together&quot;, the first single &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, and &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; (abnormally catchy with an interesting take on a crumbled relationship).  In conclusion, just give it a listen.  Borrow a copy from a friend or just listen to some samples on the Internet.  You might be pleasantly surprised.\",\n",
       " \"This album is great, my fave songs are &quot;Together&quot;, &quot;How Does It Feel&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; & &quot;Freak Out&quot;. I don't care if she's pop, this is good pop. Avril is hot and has an amazing voice. And this is coming from a System of a Down fan.I appreciate a well written song, and this album if full of them.\",\n",
       " \"Avril Lavigne sure isn't shy about revealing whats under her skin on her sophomore follow up to her debut album &#34;Let Go&#34;. On her sophomore album &#34;Under My Skin&#34; she gets more introspective, deep, and personal with her songs as well as her vocals. Especially on the songs &#34;Nobody's Home&#34;, her defiant &#34;My Happy Ending&#34; and her tender, emotional ballad &#34;Slipped Away&#34; in memory of her grandpa. Not many mainstream punk/rock singers write songs about deeply emotional material:) Avril Lavigne is one of the first or maybe THE FIRST singer of her generation to write such an intimately, emotional song and she sure won't be the last and a song of this style when written by Avril is the first of many more to follow........\",\n",
       " \"It's no doubt there was a big expectation for Lavigne's follow up.  Gladly she worked with new and fresh producers and with amazing writer Chantal K. who helped her with a few lyrics.  Overall don't expect to have the most introspective album deliver to us by this canadian brat.  After all is her second album.  The songs are simply delightful POP-ROCK tunes that aboards every theme from LOVE, SOLITUDE AND FORGIVENESS.  This is a great album from the begginning to the end.  Maybe the best coming out this year.  Of course is unfair to compare ALANIS and AVRIL since their albums came by the same time, it's just not right because the both of them are talented and most of all different. Back 2 Avril's album, the best tracks are the history telling &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; were you can tell the desperation of the caracter, well sung by Lavigne, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; the leading single a in your face love song, about, yes! she's not an easy girl, how ironic, but then it's lovely to see somebody like Avril demanding respect. Love the momentuos of the last chorus, a great song.  &quot;Who Knows&quot; this track sounds so anthemic and easy to sing along with, and a great track. &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; supposed to be the second cut to be release to radio waves, although is catchy and not bad at all, it's not one of my top tracks, but it's ok.  &quot;He Wasn't&quot; souns a lil-ske8r boi alike, this is fast, and funny to hear that the man she expected him to be is not, &quot;How Does It Feel&quot; is a slow track of put yourself in my feet, this is a more mature Lavigne, &quot;Forgotten&quot; it's a total rocker song, another mature one, but it doesn't mean it's the best one.  &quot;Freak Out&quot; sounds funny and anoying, &quot;Slipped Away&quot; dedicated to her grampa, it's sad and slow, a great closure. &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, &quot;Together&quot; both sounds a like, and &quot;Falls To Pieces&quot; is forgettable.  At the end this is a great comeback sophomore album that hopefully won't get stucked in bad promotion or radio overlooked tracks, just like many albums that came this year. This is a well invested money record.\",\n",
       " \"1. Take Me Away -As the title says, a song about feeling scared and alone, wanting to be taken away. I thought it was pretty good.2. Together -Prolly my favorite song on here. The beat isjust gorgeous, the lyrics are great, and her voice is filled with emotion.3. Don't Tell Me -A song about not letting guys control you. Thats something you gotta appreciate. Terrific song, I liked it right away.4. He Wasn't -A song with simple lyrics, but i think that might have been the point. The beat is spunky and energetic, and its a good song to jump around to.5. How Does It Feel -Not bad at all. Its a dreamy, mellowsort of song with thought provoking lyrics.6. My Happy Ending -Overplayed on the radio, but overall the song is good. A sarcastic, angry letdown of a relationship gone wrong.7. Nobody's Home -One of my favorites on here. Good beat, lyrics, and vocals. Something i can totally relate to.8. Forgotten -Another good song, about feeling forgotten about your needs not being met, and the music has an angry beat to it.9. Who Knows -This is a happy song with a good message and optimisitc lyrics. I like this song, but its not one for my bad days.10. Fall to Pieces -Softer guitar on this track. Although the lyrics are done beautifully, and the beat grows on you.It expresses the feel of the song quite well.11. Freak Out -Really good song, filled with energy and confidence. The ability to live your life and not care what other people think of you.12. Slipped Away -A song about her grandpa. A sad song, but a beautiful emotional ballad where she sings her heart out.Overall, i gave it 5 stars because i like all of the songs. I do like her first album better, but i just seem to like this one in a different way. It just seems to show a different side of her on here, revealing her true colors.\",\n",
       " \"If I had judged the album only from the singles I would have never got this album. I am glad I took a chance and got it. This album is packed with full of excellent rock vibe. She is for sure valedictorian among Alanis-school rockers.On the whole the album direction got closer to that of Evanescence's Fallen, favorable move because I love the album a lot. FORGOTTEN and TOGETHER particularly has well-polished melancholism some of the current rockers such as Evanescence and Harem Scarem are well capable of. And this is another excellent bridge between classic melodic rock and modern rock just as the aforementioned bands successfully had achieved.Yet you can still find excellent power pop tracks the debut had such as HE WASN'T, MY HAPPY ENDING, HOW DOES IT FEEL, and WHO KNOWS. Personally, however, I would like to dig into rockier side of her more. It's been the heavy rotated CD ever since I have bought this album. For sure one of the year's best.Recommended for wide range of music lovers.\",\n",
       " \"In my review for Avril's first album, I wrote, &quot;This is the best CD I've ever listened to in my life. Avril is *almost* your average 17-year-old punk. The only difference? Her amazing talent.&quot; My opinion changed a bit after seeing her live. She only played guitar on 2 or 3 songs, and her voice must've been altered a lot on the CD, because it didn't sound that good in concert.However, I've bought &quot;Under My Skin&quot; and I have to admit that Avril's done it again--she's convinced me that she's awesome. Unlike with her first album, she wrote or co-wrote all of the songs. They're more angry, and they rock harder than the ones on the first album; those songs are more upbeat and pop-ish. Even though she only plays guitar on one song, whoever's doing it does a pretty good job. Also, Ben Moody, formerly from Evanescence, plays guitar on &quot;Nobody's Home&quot;, which I thought was pretty cool.It's hard for me to pick which songs I like the best, because they are all so good. I think anyone can relate to the lyrics on this one. Most of them are about a break-up with a guy. For the people who are complaining about that, like &quot;Your Doom 'Beware' &quot;, I think writing about a breakup is a good way of taking out bad feelings about it. I don't see why it's so bad that most of her songs are probably about the same guy. It's not boring to me at all. Also, if you don't like her, why did you spend money on the album? The words might be simple because she's still young and hasn't had a lot of experience writing lyrics. It's idiotic how people don't understand that musicians are still human.Also, she might sound like Michelle Branch, Evanescence, or a female version of Dashboard Confessional, but I don't think any band or artist is going to not sound like another band or artist. Pick any band--I'm sure there's another one that sounds a least a little bit like it.I think anyone who likes music will like this album, unless they are really against angry or heartfelt songs.\",\n",
       " \"Its so sad that this girl sells albums.  Really, think about it.  She claims to be the &quot;anti-Britney&quot; or whatever, yet writes songs that are just as poppy, and basically aimed at the same audience.  She isn't &quot;punk&quot;...she's corporate pop, and poor pop at that.  If you want to hear decent pop music, listen to something like U2, or even No Doubt...at least they are good songwriters, with music that will stand the test of time.\",\n",

You shall be a punk rock star who sings about skater boys, OK?', 'I suppose so,' I'm not sure if thats 100% accurate, but I heard it through the 'punk rock' grapevine.

Avril will have a hard time creating something that even compares to this album in the coming years, Which I believe wont happen considering the changes in pop music and what sales right now.It\\'s either she makes another \\'Under My Skin\\' and flop or do another \"Best Damn Thing\" and burst, Read that sentence a few more times.Every song has it\\'s own spot on this release.The b-side to \"Don\\'t Tell Me\" which is \"Day Dream\" is also something Lavigne fans should not miss out on, It should have made the cut.This will be one of Lavigne\\'s most remembered albums in the coming years.',\n",

Don\\'t Tell Me- The first single on the album. At first I thought It was about sex but when I really listend to it. it was about being in control. What a great song. 5/54. He Wasn\\'t- At first I absolutely loved it but then It got kinda boring. I still love this song, but I usually skip it. 4/55. How Does It Feel- The ballad on the album. It may be the song everyone wants to skip but It\\'s really beautiful and worth listening to. 5/56. My Happy Ending- My personal favorite on the album. At first I didn\\'t care for this song but it has really grown on me. 5/57. Nobody\\'s Home- The best on the album. Avril wrote this song about a girl she knew who had some problems. Written beautifully. 5/58. Forgotten- The darkest song on the album with a catchy beat. 5/59. Who Knows- My least favorite off the album. Avril sings about letting yourself have a good day and there is always another. Very beautiful. 3/510. Fall To Pieces- Slow rock ballad that is very beautful. I really don\\'t care for this song but it\\'s definatly a stand out track. 4/511. Freak Out- I love this song, it\\'s so crazy. Avril sings about living your life. 5/512.

She's very changed... unfortunately.Somebody has to tell Avril she's a pop singer, not a rock singer. What she has done in this record was a mistake, she's pretending she's a rock singer but she's not. All those guitar solos, a little heavy songs... It has nothing to do with her and her voice, and few to do with the Avril we've listened in &quot;Let Go&quot;, you know what I'm saying? Avril, I hope you return to your &quot;roots&quot; in the next album.Best songs in here are indeed the singles &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and &quot;My Happy Ending&quot;. This album may entertain you for some weeks, but not for years, like &quot;Let Go&quot; did... Still, if you liked her first album, you should support her, buying this one.

It sells itself as a work of insightful genius, but has the depth of the mould on my bathroom mat. This is music made by someone who doesn\\'t give a sh*t about music, audience or even basic dignity.Her lyrics are vapid and possibly she got better on her newest album. But her \"guitar skills?\" Please. Look closely at her Complicated video. The only real chord she played was a G. Look at the tabs now. You there? Good. There is no G chord anywhere in the song. Guitars are meant to be played, they are not for decoration. She lied about her songwriting in her first album, why wouldn\\'t she on this one? Listen to her live to see what REAL talent she has. Don\\'t buy this CD.Here\\'s how I sum up Avril: She claims to be into rock, yet can not pronounce and probably has never heard of David Bowie (one of the greatest musicians EVER). She originally wanted to be a country singer. Says she hates pop music, yet sings it. All her songs are the same, it\\'s the old \"I had a boyfriend but he dumped me because I\\'m ugly, boo hoo\", roughly translated as \"A six year old could write better music than me! Buy my CD to inflate my ego and lower your IQ further!\" Only teenagers addicted to MTV who lack the determination and talent to do well at school and think they\\'re marginalised because of this will find it at all acceptable.- Zack, 16 years old',\n",
       " 'I read a few reviews about Avril\\'s CD that really were disrespectful.  I know that I might sound disrespectful by saying this, but Avril Lavigne has a good reason to dislike Britney Spears without getting to know her.  Britney Spears is morally wrong and cannot sing.  I don\\'t care what anyone says- she does not have a good voice!  She does not write but maybe a few words to each poorly produced CD she makes!  She does not play an instrument, or could even try.  I mean, Avril at least plays a little guitar in this album, which I hope to hear more of in the future.It seems like every single celebrity is getting an album these days, whether it\\'s Hilary Duff or Ashlee Simpson.  And the singers are going onto reality shows, something else I look down upon (with an exceptional few that don\\'t involve relationships and junk like that).  While some actresses and actors prove to have tolerable voices, the others just really don\\'t do much and are making albums just for the extra money that they could probably do without.  Avril Lavigne proves she can make an album without being famous first and without singing anything bubblegum.Here are 12 excellent reasons why you should pick up a copy of \"Under My Skin\":1. Take Me Away- This is my second favorite song on the album.  It\\'s very angsty and a great way to start off the album.  The only thing I hate about this song is it\\'s length- it\\'s the shortest song on the album.  But still a fabulous song nonetheless 5/52. Together- This is an example of PERFECTION!  This song blows me away everytime I listen to it.  I especially like the prechorus: \"When I\\'m alone I feel so much better, When I\\'m around you I don\\'t feel together.\"  This is my favorite song on the album. 5/53. Don\\'t Tell Me- I think this is a great single and I love the beginning verse.  It\\'s very explanatory and does well as single, but it\\'s still not the best song on the album. 4.5/54. He Wasn\\'t- This is a definite sequel to \"Sk8er Boi\" in my opinion.  It\\'s cute- I really like the riff.  The words just don\\'t do much- they kind of remind me of something Hilary Duff might sing (Sorry Avril) but it\\'s still good. 4.5/55. How Does It Feel- This is a very pretty song, talking about how Avril is different from the world.  It shows her softer, less rebellious side.  It\\'s not my favorite, I really don\\'t like the \"ah ah ah ah ah\" part, but still very beautiful in it\\'s own way. 4.5/56. My Happy Ending- At first I wasn\\'t too crazy about this being a single, but now I\\'m getting a little happier.  I like the chorus alot.  They overplay it on the radio, so I skip it on the album, but it\\'s still a five star song. 5/57. Nobody\\'s Home- I love this song!  The lyrics sound very professional and the tune is good, it was cowritten by none other than Ben Moody, another true musician. 5/58. Forgotten- This is probably the hardest song on the CD.  It\\'s definitely one of my favorites, but the words could use some working on.  Oh well, it\\'s a fabulous song. 5/59. Who Knows- This isn\\'t my favorite song, but I like it.  I really like the riff, but I think this is the ultimate filler track. 4.5/510. Fall To Peices- This is the love song of the CD- it\\'s pretty good.  It\\'s much more acoustic.  This is a good song and I don\\'t skip it.  It reminds me alot of \"Things I\\'ll Never Say\" from \"Let Go\". 4.5/511. Freak Out- This is one of my favorite songs with reason- I absolutely LOVE the first part.  It sounds a bit faded, but the guitar just sounds so awesome!! 5/512. Slipped Away- This is the perfect ending to a perfect album.  Period. 5/5Well, there you have it.  A great album.  Better than her first by far, Avril calms down a little bit and we get inside her head a little more.  Well done.']"
